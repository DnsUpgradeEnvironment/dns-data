The calculation takes into account nitrogen inputs by fertilisers, from biological nitrogen fixation, by atmospheric inputs which are not emitted by agriculture, by seed and planting material as well as imported and domestically produced feedstuff. Nitrogen removal results from plant and animal market products.<br><br><br><br>In 2016, fertilisers were the most important component of nitrogen input in the overall balance, accounting for 55.1&nbsp;% (107 kilograms of nitrogen per hectare and year). Domestic feedstuff contributed 22.4&nbsp;% (43&nbsp;kg/ha) to nitrogen input, foreign feedstuff 12.1&nbsp;% (23&nbsp;kg/ha), the biological nitrogen fixation 6.6&nbsp;% (13&nbsp;kg/ha), the non-agricultural emissions 2.0&nbsp;% (4&nbsp;kg/ha) and seed and planting material 0.7&nbsp;% (1&nbsp;kg/ha). While the nitrogen input was reduced by about 9&nbsp;% between 1990 and 2016, the nitrogen removal increased considerably more (by 41&nbsp;%) between 1990 and 2016. In 2016, almost three quarters of the nitrogen removal from agriculture was accounted for by plant products and one quarter by animal market products.<br><br><br><br>The total balance of the indicator is calculated based on the concept of the \u201cHoftor-Bilanz\u201d (farmgate balance), thus nitrogen flows within the operational cycle are not taken into account. The relevant time series for the indicator is based on the moving five-year average of the total balances of the relevant year as well as the two preceding and subsequent years. Thereby, yearly meteorological and market fluctuations, which cannot be influenced by farms, are balanced. The indicator does not provide an interpretation regarding the regional distribution of nitrogen surpluses. Even if the average value, defined as a national target for Germany, is not reached, regional nitrogen surpluses can be considerably higher than 70&nbsp;kg per hectare and year.<br><br><br><br>During the period from 1992 to 2014, the nitrogen balance fell from 121 to 97&nbsp;kg per hectare and year (\u2013 19.5&nbsp;%). Following the major reduction in nitrogen surpluses at the beginning of the time series, the nitrogen surplus fell by only 0.9&nbsp;% between 2010 and 2014. If this trend continues, decreasing the nitrogen surplus to 70&nbsp;kg/ha of utilised agricultural area on annual average between 2028 and 2032 may not be possible.<br><br><br><br>The significant reduction of the nitrogen surplus in the early 1990s resulted from diminished use of fertilisers and falling numbers of livestock in the new L\u00e4nder. The marginal decline of the indicator in the remaining course of the time series is based on a minor reduction in mineral fertiliser use and improved harvest yields resulting from technical advances in plant production and breeding (more efficient nitrogen fertilisation, variety spectrum) combined with the simultaneous expansion in the cultivation of high-yield crop types (maize, wheat) as well as improved feed conversion by livestock.<br><br><br><br>The indicator reveals a direct connection to the indicators [3.2.a](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/3-2-a/) \u201cEmissions of air pollutants\u201d, [6.1.b](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/6-1-b/) \u201cNitrate in groundwater\u201d, [14.1.a](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/14-1-a/) \u201cNitrogen input to the North and the Baltic Sea through German inflows\u201d and [15.2](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/15-2-a/) \u201cEutrophication of ecosystems\u201d.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Institute for Crop and Soil Science, Julius K\u00fchn Institute","source_organisation_1_short":"Institute for Crop and Soil Science, Julius K\u00fchn Institute","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.julius-kuehn.de/en/crop-and-soil-science/\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/jki.png\" alt=\" Institute for Crop and Soil Science, Julius K\u00fchn Institute\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_1":"https://www.bmel-statistik.de/landwirtschaft/statistischer-monatsbericht-des-bmel-kapitel-a-landwirtschaft/","source_url_text_1":"N\u00e4hrstoffbilanzen und D\u00fcngemittel (Only available in German)","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Institute of Landscape Ecology and Resources Management, University of Giessen","source_organisation_2_short":"Institute of Landscape Ecology and Resources Management, University of Giessen","source_organisation_logo_2":"<a href=\"https://www.uni-giessen.de/faculties/f09/institutes/landscape?set_language=en\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/ug.png\" alt=\" Institute of Landscape Ecology and Resources Management, University of Giessen\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_2":"https://www.bmel-statistik.de/landwirtschaft/statistischer-monatsbericht-des-bmel-kapitel-a-landwirtschaft/","source_url_text_2":"N\u00e4hrstoffbilanzen und D\u00fcngemittel (Only available in German)","history_active_1":true,"history_indicator_1":"2.1.a Nitrogen surplus in agriculture","history_target_1":"On an annual average for the period 2028 to 2032, a reduction of the nitrogen surpluses of the overall balance for Germany to 70 kilograms per hectare of utilised agricultural area","history_year_a_1":"2016","history_status_year_a_1":"Blitz","history_year_b_1":"2015","history_status_year_b_1":"Wolke","history_year_c_1":"2014","history_status_year_c_1":"Wolke","history_year_d_1":"2013","history_status_year_d_1":"Blitz","history_year_e_1":"2012","history_status_year_e_1":"Wolke","history_year_f_1":"2011","history_status_year_f_1":"Sonne","history_year_g_1":"2010","history_status_year_g_1":"Sonne","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":null,"graph_target_lines":[{"series":"Moving five-year average, referring to the middle year","value":70,"label_content":"Ziel 2030"}],"data_footnote":"2018 provisional data","computation_units":"Kilograms per hectare","copyright":"&copy;
