Nitrogen removal takes place through plant and animal market products. The surplus nitrogen may escape in gaseous form into the atmosphere, be enriched in the soil or leach into groundwater. In this way it can ultimately find its way into rivers or other ecosystems too. Here, the nitrogen surplus in agriculture has a direct effect on the trend in indicators 6.1.b (Nitrate in groundwater), 14.1.a (Nitrogen input via the inflows into the North and Baltic Seas) and 15.2 (Eutrophication of ecosystems) In the case of indicator 3.2.a (Emissions of air pollutants), nitrogen is released into the atmosphere as a result of agriculture impacts on the formation of nitrogen dioxides and ammonia.<br>The indicator is calculated by the Institute for Crop and Soil Science at the Julius K\u00fchn Institute and the Institute of Landscape Ecology and Resources Management at the University of Giessen. <br>For 2018, fertilisers were found to be the main source of nitrogen input, accounting for 54.5% (94 kg nitrogen per hectare) in the overall nitrogen balance. Other important sources of nitrogen input were animal feed, with 34.1% (59 kg/ha), biological fixation, with 7.6% (13 kg/ha) and non-agricultural emissions, with 1.8% (3 kg/ha). The calculation of the indicator is based on a five-year moving average, the mean value being obtained from five reference years. The five-year moving average provides the value for the middle year of the five reference years. The figure thus takes account of year-to-year fluctuations caused by meteorological and market conditions which are beyond the control of farms. The indicator gives no information on the regional distribution of nitrogen surpluses. For the years 2016 and 2017 various input data were retrospectively updated. The calculation method was also revised, and some coefficients were updated. This has given rise to divergences from the indicator values shown in the previous publication.<br>In the period from 1992 to 2016, the moving five-year average nitrogen surplus fell by 19.9% from 116.6 to 93.3 kilograms per hectare/year. The reductions in the nitrogen surplus, however, are largely due to developments from the start of the time series until 2011. Since then the nitrogen surplus has stagnated, and it now remains at the 2011 level of 93 kg/ha. If the current trend continues, the aim of a reduction to an annual average of 70 kilograms per hectare of utilised agricultural area by the reference period 2028-2032 will not be achievable. The significant reduction of the nitrogen surplus at the start of the 1990s resulted from reduced use of fertilisers and falling livestock numbers in the new L\u00e4nder. The comparatively meagre decline over the remainder of the time series stemmed from a slight decline in the use of mineral fertilisers and higher crop yields resulting from technical progress in plant production and cultivation, reflected in more efficient nitrogen usage and in the range of crop varieties. The same period has seen increases in the area given over to high-yield crops, such as maize and wheat, and improvements in feed conversion efficiency in livestock farming.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bmel.de/EN/Home/home_node.html\">Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.bmel.de/EN/Home/home_node.html\">Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bmel.de/EN/Home/home_node.html\"><img src=\"ttps://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/bmel.png\" alt=\"Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Ministry of Food and Agriculture\" style=\"height:60px;
