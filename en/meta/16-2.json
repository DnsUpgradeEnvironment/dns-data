This special evaluation found that the number of projects run per year rose from 8 in 2006 to 31 in 2019. According to the evaluation, the goal of Germany involving itself through at least 15 projects annually was already achieved for the first time in 2012. With the exception of 2013, that target was also reached or even exceeded in the years that followed. The regional focuses of Germany\u2019s involvement were in East and West Africa, the Western Balkans and Ukraine. Other projects were supported in Latin America and the Caribbean. It is possible that projects with run-times longer than one year were counted more than once.<br>The projects reported are not all financed exclusively by the Federal Foreign Office but may also receive third-party funds. The indicator therefore includes those projects only partially funded from the public purse. Notably, the number of projects carried out says nothing about their scale or their level of success. Clearly formulated and communicated criteria are essential, moreover, for a project to be unequivocally categorised as in line with the indicator\u2019s aims. The German Government\u2019s Annual Disarmament Report contains a list of projects with the objective of SALW control, alongside their sources of funding. Their number differs from those reported for this indicator. One reason for this may be the particular focus of individual projects, which affects whether they are taken into account. This means that the indicator depicts more than the extent of state involvement in these projects.<br>In accordance with the guidelines on statistical reporting issued by its Development Assistance Committee, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) also publishes detailed figures on projects for reintegration and SALW control (CRS Purpose Code 15240). There are some discrepancies here too, which may arise from a project, though its objective is SALW control, being part of a larger project with a focus which precludes its inclusion in this category.<br>If the indicator were based on the number of projects counted in the above-mentioned OECD category, the target of at least 15 projects would have been reached in 2006 and every year since 2016. The target value would not have been achieved in the intervening years. In 2019, the OECD counted 22 projects. However, those projects also included measures for reintegrating former combatants from armed groups into society. Without such reintegration projects, the number of project exclusively or chiefly intended to combat SALW would be lower.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en\">Federal Foreign Office</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en\">Federal Foreign Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en\"><img src=\"ttps://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/aa.png\" alt=\"Federal Foreign Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Foreign Office\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"16.2 Number of projects to secure, register and destroy small arms and light weapons carried out by Germany in affected regions of the world","weather_indicator_1_year_a":"2020","weather_indicator_1_year_b":"2019","weather_indicator_1_year_c":"2018","weather_indicator_1_year_d":"2017","weather_indicator_1_year_e":"2016","weather_indicator_1_year_f":"2015","weather_indicator_1_year_g":"2014","weather_indicator_1_target":"At least 15 projects per year by 2030","weather_indicator_1_item_a":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_item_a_title":"Der Zielwert oder ein besserer Wert wurde im letzten Jahr erreicht und die durchschnittliche Ver\u00e4nderung deutet nicht in Richtung einer Verschlechterung.","weather_indicator_1_item_b":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_item_b_title":"Der Zielwert oder ein besserer Wert wurde im letzten Jahr erreicht und die durchschnittliche Ver\u00e4nderung deutet nicht in Richtung einer Verschlechterung.","weather_indicator_1_item_c":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_item_c_title":"Der Zielwert oder ein besserer Wert wurde im letzten Jahr erreicht und die durchschnittliche Ver\u00e4nderung deutet nicht in Richtung einer Verschlechterung.","weather_indicator_1_item_d":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_item_d_title":"Der Zielwert oder ein besserer Wert wurde im letzten Jahr erreicht und die durchschnittliche Ver\u00e4nderung deutet nicht in Richtung einer Verschlechterung.","weather_indicator_1_item_e":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_item_e_title":"Der Zielwert oder ein besserer Wert wurde im letzten Jahr erreicht und die durchschnittliche Ver\u00e4nderung deutet nicht in Richtung einer Verschlechterung.","weather_indicator_1_item_f":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_item_f_title":"Der Zielwert oder ein besserer Wert wurde im letzten Jahr erreicht und die durchschnittliche Ver\u00e4nderung deutet nicht in Richtung einer Verschlechterung.","weather_indicator_1_item_g":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_item_g_title":"Der Zielwert oder ein besserer Wert wurde im letzten Jahr erreicht und die durchschnittliche Ver\u00e4nderung deutet nicht in Richtung einer Verschlechterung.","data_show_map":false,"copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2022","data_footnote":"Data based on a special evaluation.","graph_title":"Number of projects to secure, register and destroy small arms and light weapons in affected regions of the world","graph_annotations":[{"value":15.0,"label":{"content":"Constant target","position":"left"},"preset":"target_line"}],"span_gaps":true,"show_line":true,"graph_type":"bar","data_start_values":[{"field":"Time series","value":"Number of projects to secure, register and destroy small arms and light weapons carried out by Germany in affected regions of the world"}],"page_content":"\n\n<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h5>Securing, registration and destruction of weapons: At least 15 projects per year by 2030\n      <a href=\"https://dnsUpgradeEnvironment.github.io/dns-indicators/en/status\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Sonne.png\" title=\"The target value or a better value was achieved in the last year and the average change does not point in the direction of deterioration.\" alt=\"Weathersymbol: Sun\"/>\n      </a>\n    </h5>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"my-header-note\">\n  </div>\n</div>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-09-15","national_data_updated_date":"2022-08-29","indicator_number":"16.2","target_number":"16.2","goal_number":"16","language":"en"}
