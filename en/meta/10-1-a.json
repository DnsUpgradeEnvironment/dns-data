A basic prerequisite for successful integration is the acquisition of sufficient qualifications at school to open up further educational and employment opportunities later on. The goal of the Federal Government is therefore to increase the share of foreign school graduates who obtain at least a secondary general school certificate and to bring this share into line with the corresponding rate for German school graduates by 2030.","data_state":"Der Indikatorenbericht 2021 hat den Datenstand 31.12.2020.

These statistics are generally derived from a complete count with an obligation to provide information. The Federal Statistical Office combines them to create a federal result based on the catalogue of definitions compiled by the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs.<br><br><br><br>The aggregation of the L\u00e4nder results into the federal result is influenced by the different education policies of the L\u00e4nder, for example, with regard to admission rules, in setting up courses of education in the area of vocational schools, etc. This can only be partially offset by formal regulations for the respective allocations.<br><br><br><br>Graduates are pupils who have left the respective type of school with a school certificate. Included are pupils who have changed to another type of general education school in order to obtain an additional certificate. Furthermore, foreigners are defined as all persons who are not German within the meaning of Article 116 (1) of the Basic Law, i.e. who do not hold the German citizenship. This also includes persons who are stateless and persons with undetermined citizenship. Germans who also hold another citizenship are not included in the foreign population.<br><br><br><br>In 2017, the share of foreign school graduates who obtained at least a secondary general school certificate measured against all foreign school leavers was 81.9&nbsp;%. Consequently, the share has increased by 3.9 percentage points compared with the previous year. Regarding the gender-specific shares, the share of foreign female graduates in all foreign female leavers was 86.4&nbsp;%, whereas the share of male graduates in all foreign male leavers was lower at 78.1&nbsp;%.<br><br><br><br>The share of German school graduates who obtained at least a secondary general school certificate, measured against all German school leavers, was most recently 94.8&nbsp;% and therefore stable. The gap between the share of foreign school graduates and German school graduates slightly increased from 12.0 percentage points in 1996 to 12.9 percentage points in 2017. After the values tended to converge up to 2013, they have been diverging since then.<br><br><br><br>Considering the certificates obtained shows that almost 28.4&nbsp;% of foreign school graduates from general education schools achieved a secondary general school certificate in 2017, 36.1&nbsp;% completed their schooling with a mid-level certificate, and 17.4&nbsp;% earned a higher education entrance qualification for general or applied sciences universities. The corresponding figures among German school graduates were 15.0&nbsp;%, 43.6&nbsp;% and 36.3&nbsp;%. Young foreign people are thus substantially under-represented in comparison to Germans, especially when it comes to the higher-level school leaving certificates.<br><br><br><br>The indicator 4.1.a \u201cEarly school leavers\u201d also offers additional information on the topic of school graduates.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Federal Statistical Office (Destatis)","source_organisation_1_short":"Federal Statistical Office","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/destatis.png\" alt=\" Federal Statistical Office\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" /></a>","history_active_1":true,"history_indicator_1":"10.1 Foreign school graduates","history_target_1":"Increase the proportion of foreign school leavers with a least a secondary general school certificate by 2030","history_year_a_1":"2019","history_status_year_a_1":"Blitz","history_year_b_1":"2018","history_status_year_b_1":"Blitz","history_year_c_1":"2017","history_status_year_c_1":"Blitz","history_year_d_1":"2016","history_status_year_d_1":"Blitz","history_year_e_1":"2015","history_status_year_e_1":"Wolke","history_year_f_1":"2014","history_status_year_f_1":"Wolke","history_year_g_1":"2013","history_status_year_g_1":"Sonne","data_show_map":true,"data_keywords":null,"data_start_values":["Foreign school graduates","German school graduates (share of all german leavers)"],"data_footnote":"Federal States: Gender-specific distribution of foreign graduates, partly estimated.
