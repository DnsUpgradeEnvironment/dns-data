Germany\u2019s efforts to strengthen international knowledge-sharing are important in this context. For this reason, the aim of the German Government is to increase the total number of students and researchers from developing and emerging countries by 10% from 2015 to 2020 and to keep the number stable at that level thereafter.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2021 is as of 31.12.2020. The data shown on the DNS-Online-Platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the indicator report 2021.","indicator_name":"Number of students and researchers from developing countries and LDC per year","section":"Knowledge transfer, especially in technical areas","postulate":"Sharing knowledge internationally","target_id":"17.2.1","previous":"17-1","next":"17-3","content_and_progress":"<i>Text from the Indicator Report 2021 </i>The data for the indicator are official student statistics and the statistics on university personnel collated by the Federal Statistical Office.<br>Data from the Federal Statistical Office both are complete counts based on the administrative data maintained by Germany\u2019s institutions of higher education. The indicator includes all students enrolled in the winter semester starting in the relevant year. To obtain that statistic, all the higher-education institutions access the required data via their administration programs on the day set for the survey.<br>The number of researchers is recorded on the reporting date of 1 December. Researchers in this context are defined as full-time and part-time academic staff at German institutions of higher education (excluding undergraduate assistants). PhD candidates who are enrolled as students at an institution of higher education and simultaneously employed as academic staff can result in duplicate entries in the indicator.<br>The total number of all students and researchers from developing and emerging countries at German institutions of higher education in 2019 was 285,000. At 92.7%, students accounted for by far the larger share of the total indicator value.<br>In the 2019/20 winter semester, 264,555 students from developing and emerging countries were enrolled in German institutions of higher education. This corresponds to 9% of all enrolled students. The number of students from developing and emerging countries has increased steadily from the 134,462 recorded in 2005. The only decline recorded was in 2007. The figure for the 2019/20 winter semester represented a 6.6% increase on the approximately 250,000 students recorded in the 2018/19 winter semester. In winter semester 2019/20, a total of 13,067 students came from LDCs \u2013 13.4% more than the previous year.<br>Of the students from developing and emerging countries, 44,490 came from China, 38,902 from Turkey and 25,149 from India. In total, 42.0% of them were female. Whereas the European developing and emerging countries send roughly equal numbers of women and men to study in Germany (54.0%), less than a quarter of students from Oceania are women (23.5%). The proportion of women among students from LDCs was slightly more than a quarter (27.1%).<br>In 2019, around 21,000 researchers from developing and emerging countries were members of academic staff at German institutions of higher education. They accounted for 5.1% of all academic staff at German institutions of higher education. The proportion of people from developing and emerging countries was thus markedly smaller among researchers than among students. Their numbers increased by 9.3% compared to the previous year and have more than tripled since 2005. A total of 681 researchers came from LDCs in 2019 (0.2% of all academic staff). The equivalent figure for the previous year was 687, so there was a slight reduction.<br>The target of raising the number of students and researchers from developing and emerging countries by 10% compared to the 215,000 recorded for 2015 was already achieved in 2017.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\"><img src=\"ttps://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/destatis.png\" alt=\"Federal Statistical Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Statistical Office\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"17.2 Number of students and researchers from developing countries and LDCs per year","weather_indicator_1_year_a":"2020","weather_indicator_1_year_b":"2019","weather_indicator_1_year_c":"2018","weather_indicator_1_year_d":"2017","weather_indicator_1_year_e":"2016","weather_indicator_1_year_f":"2015","weather_indicator_1_year_g":"2014","weather_indicator_1_target":"Increase the number by 10% from 2015 to 2020, then stabilised","weather_indicator_1_target_1":"Increase the number by 10% from 2015 to 2020","weather_indicator_1_target_1_year":"2020","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_e":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_f":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_g":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_2":"Stabilisation","weather_indicator_1_target_2_year":"2030","weather_indicator_1_target_2_item_a":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_2_item_b":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_2_item_c":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_2_item_d":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_2_item_e":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_2_item_f":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_2_item_g":"Sonne","data_show_map":true,"copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2022","data_footnotes":"The target for 2020 corresponds to a 10% increase in the number of students and researchers compared to 2015.<br>\u2022 LDCs: least developed countries.<br>\u2022 Data based on a special evaluation.","graph_title":"Students and researchers in Germany from developing and emerging countries","graph_annotations":[{"value":236780.0,"label":{"content":"Target 2020","position":"left"},"preset":"target_line"},{"value":272176.0,"label":{"content":"Target 2030","position":"left"},"preset":"target_line"}],"precision":[{"decimals":0.0}],"span_gaps":true,"show_line":true,"graph_type":"bar","data_start_values":[{"field":"Time series","value":"Number of students and researchers from developing countries and LDCs per year"}],"national_geographical_coverage":"Germany","page_content":"\n\n<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h3>\n      <a href=\"https://dnsTestEnvironment.github.io/dns-indicators/en/status\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Sonne.png\" title=\"Text will follow soon\" alt=\"Wettersymbol\"/>\n      </a>\n    </h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"my-header-note\">\n  </div>\n</div>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-08-29","national_data_updated_date":"2022-08-29","indicator_number":"17.2","target_number":"17.2","goal_number":"17","language":"en"}
