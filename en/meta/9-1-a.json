The main criterion that differentiates R&D from related activities is the existence of an appreciable element of novelty or advancement from a previous position.<br>The Federal Statistical Office annually calculates how much has been spent on research and development as a proportion of gross domestic product. Overall spending on research and development comprises expenditure by the public sector (including private non-profit research institutions), businesses and institutions of higher education. The data-gathering and calculations adhere to the recommended methodologies of the OECD Frascati Manual on statistics about research and development, which enables international comparisons.<br>Overall R&D expenditure in Germany in 2018 amounted to EUR 104.7 billion, equivalent to 3.1% of GDP. It was thus 0.4 percentage points below the target set for 2025 of at least 3.5% of GDP annually. The intended target has not been reached.<br>Since 2000, spending on research and development in Germany has risen by about 0.7 percentage points as a proportion of GDP. The indicator has shown the strongest growth since 2007.

On the other hand, several countries are ahead of Germany, including Sweden and Japan (both at 3.3%).<br>In 2018, the private sector accounted for by far the largest share of R&D expenditure in Germany at 68.9%, with 17.6% spent by institutions of higher education and a further 13.5% by public and private non-profit research institutions. Staff employed in R&D comprised around 708,000 full-time equivalents, a figure that includes only the share of their working hours actually spent on R&D work. Some 63.7% of these employees work in the private sector, 20.8% in institutions of higher education and 15.5% in public or private non-profit research institutions.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\"><img src=\"ttps://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/destatis.png\" alt=\"Federal Statistical Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Statistical Office\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_1":"https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis//online?operation=table&code=21821-0001&bypass=true&levelindex=0&levelid=1660726117256#abreadcrumb","source_url_text_1":"Research and development expenditure and staff (Germany)","source_url_1b":"https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis//online?operation=table&code=21821-0002&bypass=true&levelindex=1&levelid=1623135114747#abreadcrumb","source_url_text_1b":"Research and development expenditure and staff (L\u00e4nder)","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"<a href=\"https://www.stifterverband.org/wissenschaftsstatistik\">Stifteverband Wissenschaftsstatistik</a>","source_organisation_2_short":"<a href=\"https://www.stifterverband.org/wissenschaftsstatistik\">Stifteverband Wissenschaftsstatistik</a>","source_organisation_logo_2":"<a href=\"https://www.stifterverband.org/wissenschaftsstatistik\"><img src=\"ttps://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/svws.png\" alt=\"Stifteverband Wissenschaftsstatistik\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationStifteverband Wissenschaftsstatistik\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"9.1.a Private and public expenditure on research and development","weather_indicator_1_year_a":"2020","weather_indicator_1_year_b":"2019","weather_indicator_1_year_c":"2018","weather_indicator_1_year_d":"2017","weather_indicator_1_year_e":"2016","weather_indicator_1_year_f":"2015","weather_indicator_1_year_g":"2014","weather_indicator_1_target":"At least 3.5% of GDP per year by 2025","weather_indicator_1_item_a":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_item_b":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_item_c":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_item_d":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_item_e":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_item_f":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_item_g":"Wolke","data_show_map":false,"copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2022","data_footnote":"2019 provisional data; business enterprise sector: survey by state only in odd-numbered years, in even-numbered years the breakdown by state is based on the percentage of the respective previous year.","graph_title":"Private and public expenditure on research and development","graph_annotations":[{"value":3.5,"label":{"content":"Constant target","position":"left"},"preset":"target_line"}],"precision":[{"decimals":2.0}],"span_gaps":true,"show_line":true,"graph_type":"line","data_start_values":[{"field":"Time series","value":"Private and public expenditure on research and development"}],"graph_limits":[{"minimum":0.0,"maximum":4.0}],"graph_stepsize":[{"step":0.5}],"national_geographical_coverage":"Germany","page_content":"\n\n<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h5>Expenditure on research and development: J\u00e4hrlich mindestens 3,5&nbsp;% des BIP bis 2025\n      <a href=\"www.dnsUpgradeEnvironment.github.io/dns-indicators/en/status\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Wolke.png\" title=\"Text will follow soon\" alt=\"Wettersymbol\"/>\n      </a>\n    </h5>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"my-header-note\">\n  </div>\n</div>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-09-14","national_data_updated_date":"2022-08-26","indicator_number":"9.1.a","target_number":"9.1","goal_number":"9","language":"en"}
