Therefore, all areas not covered by the category of housing and transport area are included. A distinction must be made between open space areas, and open areas as well as housing open areas, such as cemeteries, gardens, parks, green spaces or wildlife preserves, which \u2013 although they are non-built-up areas \u2013 are considered part of the housing and transport area. Therefore, if buildings are erected in gardens, parks or green spaces, this development will not be reflected in this indicator. However, such a development would increase the population density. In this respect, the indicator \u201cLoss of open space area\u201d corresponds to indicators [11.1.a](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/11-1-a/) \u201cExpansion of housing and transport area \u201c and [11.1.c](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/11-1-c/) \u201cDensity of settlements\u201d.<br><br><br><br>The data sources for the indicator are the population figures and the area survey by type of actual use compiled by the Federal Statistical Office. Since population data at regional level are used for the calculation, the 2011 census caused a jump in the time series. Moreover, changes in the methodology of the official land registers in the L\u00e4nder have increasingly resulted in the reclassification of areas in previous years. To smooth out these effects and to establish the long-term trend, a four-year moving average is calculated, which covers the four preceding years.<br><br><br><br>Regarding the area survey by type of actual use, a methodological change in the survey basis took place in 2016, so that the comparability of the data with previous years is limited from 2016 onwards. For this reason, the development of the indicator in 2016 is shown only as a four-year moving average.<br><br><br><br>The distinction between \u201crural\u201d and \u201cnon-rural\u201d is based on a type classification of the Th\u00fcnen Institute. This classification allocates a degree of \u201cruralness\u201d to rural districts and towns not attached to an administrative district \u2013 based on spatial characteristics such as \u201cdensity of settlements\u201d, \u201cshare of agricultural and forestry area\u201d and \u201clocation relative to the centres\u201d.<br><br><br><br>In the period under review, the loss of per capita open space area declined on average nationwide. Whereas the four-year moving average for 2004 was still around 5 square metres per capita and year, the current average for 2015 is only about 2.9 square metres.<br><br><br><br>Although subject to a similar trend, considerable differences can be observed between rural and non-rural district types in terms of the scope of change. For instance, the loss of open space area per capita and year in rural district types decreased from above 7 to slightly over 4 square metres. In the non-rural district types, it fell from just under 2 to around 1 square metre. In this context, it is important to remember that non-rural districts and towns not attached to an administrative district have much less open space area such as forests or agricultural land than rural areas. In addition, demographic trends develop at differing rates and have a corresponding impact on the indicator. Whereas the majority of rural regions in the period under review reported a decline in population, the population figures in non-rural regions as a whole increased slightly.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Federal Statistical Office (Destatis)","source_organisation_1_short":"Federal Statistical Office","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/destatis.png\" alt=\" Federal Statistical Office\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Federal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development (BBSR)","source_organisation_2_short":"Federal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development","source_organisation_logo_2":"<a href=\"https://www.bbsr.bund.de/BBSR/EN/home/_node.html\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/bbsr.png\" alt=\" Federal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","source_active_3":true,"source_organisation_3":"Th\u00fcnen-Institut","source_organisation_3_short":"Johann Heinrich von Th\u00fcnen-Institut","source_organisation_logo_3":"<a href=\"https://www.thuenen.de/en/\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/jht.png\" alt=\" Johann Heinrich von Th\u00fcnen-Institut\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","history_active_1":true,"history_indicator_1":"11.1.b Loss of open space area","history_target_1":"Reduce the loss of per capita open space area","history_year_a_1":"2018","history_status_year_a_1":"Leicht bew\u00f6lkt","history_year_b_1":"2017","history_status_year_b_1":"Leicht bew\u00f6lkt","history_year_c_1":"2016","history_status_year_c_1":"Sonne","history_year_d_1":"2015","history_status_year_d_1":"Sonne","history_year_e_1":"2014","history_status_year_e_1":"Leicht bew\u00f6lkt","history_year_f_1":"2013","history_status_year_f_1":"Sonne","history_year_g_1":"2012","history_status_year_g_1":"Sonne","data_show_map":true,"data_keywords":null,"data_start_values":[{"field":"Typification","value":"Rural and non-rural areas"},{"field":"Typification","value":"Non-rural areas"},{"field":"Typification","value":"Rural areas"}],"data_footnote":"A new catalogue of types of use has been applied since the data basis was changed as of 31 December 2016 so that the relevant change from 2015 to 2016 cannot be determined.
