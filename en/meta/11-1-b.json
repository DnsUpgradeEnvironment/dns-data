The intention is therefore to curb the decline in open space area per capita. A reduction in the loss of open space area points to the success of measures to strengthen brownfield development with a view to saving agricultural land, woodland and water systems for farming, forestry, nature conservation and recreational use by the public.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of 31.10.2022. The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/publications/reports/en/2022.pdf\">indicator report 2022</a>.","indicator_name":"Loss of open space area","section":"Land use","postulate":"Using land sustainably","target_id":"11.1.1","previous":"11-1-a","next":"11-1-c","content_and_progress":"<i>Text from the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/publications/reports/en/2022.pdf\">Indicator Report 2022&nbsp;</a></i><br><br>Open space area includes areas of vegetation, such as arable land, pasture and woodland, as well as mining land and bodies of water. A distinction is made between open space proper and open areas within settlement zones, such as cemeteries, gardens, parks and recreational amenities, which, although largely undeveloped, are generally considered part of settlement and transport area. As a result, if previously undeveloped parts of settlement land are built on, this is not reflected in the indicator for loss of open space area.<br><br>In the period under review, the national average for per capita loss of open space area went down. Whereas the four-year moving average for 2001-2004&nbsp;was still around 5&nbsp;m\u00b2 per capita, the current average for 2015-2018&nbsp;reveals a figure of just 3&nbsp;m\u00b2.<br><br>Although subject to a similar trend, significant differences can be observed between rural and non-rural areas in terms of the degree of change. The loss of per capita open space area per inhabitant in rural areas contracted from 7.4&nbsp;to 4.5&nbsp;m\u00b2 per year In non-rural areas, it fell from 1.8&nbsp;m\u00b2 to 0.6&nbsp;m\u00b2. In this context, it important to remember that non-rural districts and district-free cities have much less open space, such as forest or farmland, than rural areas do. Demographic trends also differ, and the indicator reflects those disparities, with rural areas mostly seeing their populations shrink during the period under review, while population numbers in non-rural areas rose slightly overall.<br><br>The data sources for the indicator are the population figures and the area survey by type of actual use compiled by the Federal Statistical Office. Since population data at regional level are used for the associated calculations, the 2011&nbsp;census caused a jump in the time series. Moreover, some areas of land have been reclassified in the official land register maintained by the L\u00e4nder in recent years, without any actual change to the landscape. To smooth out these effects and depict the long-term trend, a four-year moving average is shown, averaging out the figures for each year with those for the three preceding years. Additionally, the switch from the old to the new land-use classification system was completed in 2016, which affected the official land-use statistics such that the data for 2016&nbsp;are not directly comparable to those for previous years. This is why the development of the indicator for 2016&nbsp;is only shown as a broken outline in the graph.<br><br>The distinction between rural and non-rural is based on a classification used by the Th\u00fcnen Institute. The institute ascribes a degree of rurality to districts and district-free cities on the basis of geographical characteristics such as settlement density and share of farmland and woodland. The classification is thus applied to whole districts rather than to smaller entities like towns or villages.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\"><img src=\"https://dnsUpgradeEnvironment.github.io/dns-indicators/public/OrgImgEn/destatis.png\" alt=\"Federal Statistical Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Statistical Office\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"<a href=\"https://www.bbsr.bund.de/BBSR/EN/home/_node.html\">Federal Office for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development</a>","source_organisation_2_short":"<a href=\"https://www.bbsr.bund.de/BBSR/EN/home/_node.html\">Federal Office for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development</a>","source_organisation_logo_2":"<a href=\"https://www.bbsr.bund.de/BBSR/EN/home/_node.html\"><img src=\"https://dnsUpgradeEnvironment.github.io/dns-indicators/public/OrgImgEn/bbsr.png\" alt=\"Federal Office for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Office for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","source_active_3":true,"source_organisation_3":"<a href=\"https://www.thuenen.de/en/\">Th\u00fcnen Institute</a>","source_organisation_3_short":"<a href=\"https://www.thuenen.de/en/\">Th\u00fcnen Institute</a>","source_organisation_logo_3":"<a href=\"https://www.thuenen.de/en/\"><img src=\"https://dnsUpgradeEnvironment.github.io/dns-indicators/public/OrgImgEn/jht.png\" alt=\"Th\u00fcnen Institute\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationTh\u00fcnen Institute\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"11.1.b Loss of open space area","weather_indicator_1_year_a":"2020","weather_indicator_1_year_b":"2019","weather_indicator_1_year_c":"2018","weather_indicator_1_year_d":"2017","weather_indicator_1_year_e":"2016","weather_indicator_1_year_f":"2015","weather_indicator_1_year_g":"2014","weather_indicator_1_target":"Reduce the loss of per capita open space area","weather_indicator_1_item_a":"Leicht bew\u00f6lkt","weather_indicator_1_item_a_title":"The average development aims in the right direction, but in the last year there was a development in the wrong direction or no change at all.","weather_indicator_1_item_b":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_item_b_title":"In 2019 both the average value and the previous annual change pointed in the right direction.","weather_indicator_1_item_c":"Leicht bew\u00f6lkt","weather_indicator_1_item_c_title":"In 2018 the average development aimed in the right direction, but in the previous year there had been a development in the wrong direction or no change at all.","weather_indicator_1_item_d":"Leicht bew\u00f6lkt","weather_indicator_1_item_d_title":"In 2017 the average development aimed in the right direction, but in the previous year there had been a development in the wrong direction or no change at all.","weather_indicator_1_item_e":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_item_e_title":"In 2016 both the average value and the previous annual change pointed in the right direction.","weather_indicator_1_item_f":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_item_f_title":"In 2015 both the average value and the previous annual change pointed in the right direction.","weather_indicator_1_item_g":"Leicht bew\u00f6lkt","weather_indicator_1_item_g_title":"In 2014 the average development aimed in the right direction, but in the previous year there had been a development in the wrong direction or no change at all.","data_show_map":true,"copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2022","data_footnotes":"A change in the data underpinning this indicator took effect on 31&nbsp;December 2016, with a new land-use classification system being used from then on.
