Indicator 15.3.b covers Germany\u2019s gross bilateral development expenditure in connection with the implementation of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) in developing and emerging countries.","dns_indicator_intention":"Preventing deforestation and forest degradation (damage), managing forests sustainably, restoring forests and creating new woodland all directly and indirectly help to maintain biodiversity, improve soil, water and air quality, reduce soil erosion, cut CO\u2082 emissions, sequester carbon, and safeguard important prospects of development and income-generation for forest-rich countries. The aim is to keep increasing payments under the REDD+ rulebook until 2030. Healthy soils are an essential natural resource that is extremely difficult if not impossible to renew. They play a pivotal role in food production, the mitigation of the effects of frequent and extreme weather events, the conservation of biodiversity and the provision of essential ecosystem services. The goal is therefore to continuously increase Germany\u2019s contribution to international soil protection until 2030. At the international level, combating desertification is one of the topics of the three Rio Conventions, alongside biodiversity and climate change.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2021 is as of 31.12.2020.

REDD+ is an international concept which financially rewards governments and local communities in developing countries for reducing deforestation and thereby demonstrably cutting emissions. Contributions are paid in line with the scale of the emissions reduction measured or the amount of additional carbon sequestered. The data sources for the indicator are the financial reports compiled by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety. The data have been collected annually since 2008. Duplicate counting is avoided by means of the mandatory establishment of a register.<br>The overall trend is positive. During the 2009-2019 reporting period, payments rose from EUR 3.0 million to EUR 63.5 million. The years 2011 and 2015 both saw a fall in payments. Of the funds paid out in 2019, EUR 50 million (78.7%) went to the multilateral Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) and EUR 13.5 million (21.3%) to the bilateral REDD Early Movers Programme. No payments were made to the Amazon Fund for Forest Conservation and Climate in 2018 and 2019.<br>The indicator depicts part of Germany\u2019s official development expenditure on the preservation, sustainable management and restoration of forests. Germany also supports the FCPF Readiness Fund and other programmes. Altogether, total spending for international forest conservation for 2019 amounted to EUR 660.4 million.<br>The data source for indicator 15.3.b is the statistics on German official development assistance which are compiled by the Federal Statistical Office on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development. Relevant projects are any which Target to combat desertification or to mitigate the effects of droughts by preventing or reducing soil degradation, restoring degraded land or recultivating desert regions. However, the amounts paid give no indication as to the actual development of soil quality.<br>Gross development expenditure to combat desertification worldwide rose strongly in the reporting period starting in 2009. The indicator has developed positively with regard to the target set. Gross expenditure was most recently recorded at EUR 745.6 million for 2019, an 18-fold increase on the equivalent figure for 2009. A similar trend is discernible in the funds committed, which were most recently recorded at EUR 896.2 million.<br>Development spending under the REDD+ rulebook and in the context of the UNCCD is part of climate finance (indicator 13.1.b) and of official development assistance (indicator 17.1).","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\"><img src=\"ttps://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/destatis.png\" alt=\"Federal Statistical Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Statistical Office\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"<a href=\"https://www.bmz.de/en/index.html\">Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development</a>","source_organisation_2_short":"<a href=\"https://www.bmz.de/en/index.html\">Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development</a>","source_organisation_logo_2":"<a href=\"https://www.bmz.de/en/index.html\"><img src=\"ttps://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/bmz.png\" alt=\"Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"15.3.a Preservation or restoration of forests in developing countries under the REDD+ rulebook","weather_indicator_1_year_a":"2020","weather_indicator_1_year_b":"2019","weather_indicator_1_year_c":"2018","weather_indicator_1_year_d":"2017","weather_indicator_1_year_e":"2016","weather_indicator_1_year_f":"2015","weather_indicator_1_year_g":"2014","weather_indicator_1_target":"Increase payments by 2030","weather_indicator_1_item_a":"Leicht bew\u00f6lkt","weather_indicator_1_item_b":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_item_c":"Leicht bew\u00f6lkt","weather_indicator_1_item_d":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_item_e":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_item_f":"Blitz","weather_indicator_1_item_g":"Leicht bew\u00f6lkt","weather_active_2":true,"weather_indicator_2":"15.3.b German gross bilateral development expenditure for the implementation of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification","weather_indicator_2_year_a":"2020","weather_indicator_2_year_b":"2019","weather_indicator_2_year_c":"2018","weather_indicator_2_year_d":"2017","weather_indicator_2_year_e":"2016","weather_indicator_2_year_f":"2015","weather_indicator_2_year_g":"2014","weather_indicator_2_target":"Payments to be increased by 2030","weather_indicator_2_item_a":"Leicht bew\u00f6lkt","weather_indicator_2_item_b":"Sonne","weather_indicator_2_item_c":"Sonne","weather_indicator_2_item_d":"Sonne","weather_indicator_2_item_e":"Sonne","weather_indicator_2_item_f":"Sonne","weather_indicator_2_item_g":"Leicht bew\u00f6lkt","data_show_map":false,"copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2022","data_footnote":"Financial contributions before 2013 were made in anticipation of the REDD+ rulebook.
