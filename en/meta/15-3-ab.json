REDD+ rewards governments and local communities financially for reducing deforestation and thereby demonstrably cutting emissions. The sums paid out are based on the scope of emissions reduced or of carbon stored. REDD+ funds are disbursed only after the reduction in deforestation has been verified \u2013 which means they are result-based. Consequently, the indicator may fluctuate over time even though the level of committed payments remains unchanged over the years.<br><br><br><br>The indicator includes only part of the public development expenditure for the preservation, sustainable management and restoration of forests since the Federal Government is involved in promoting sustainable forest development in developing and emerging countries not only as part of REDD+ but also through other programmes and initiatives.<br><br><br><br>Payments made under the REDD+ rulebook are also part of climate finance (indicator [13.1.b](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/13-1-b/)), as the preservation of forests serves primarily to limit emissions.<br><br><br><br>The data sources used for the indicator are the financial reports compiled by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and by the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety. The data have been collected annually since 2008.<br><br><br><br>In the reference period between 2009 and 2017, the indicator developed in a very uneven manner. Following an increase from 3.0 million euros in 2009 to 20.0 million euros in 2010, the payments fell to 12.0 million euros in 2011, before increasing sharply to 36.3 million euros in 2013. Payments declined in the following two years to stand at 15.7 million euros in 2015, well below the level of 2010, before increasing sharply again in 2016 and 2017. In 2017, payments totalled 68.0 million euros, the highest level to date, and almost doubled compared to 2013. Of this amount, 58.9 million euros went to multilateral programmes, and 9.1 million euros to bilateral programmes. The development of the indicator since 2010 does not reveal a definitive trend. Strong increases in payments have always been followed by declines.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Federal Statistical Office (Destatis)","source_organisation_1_short":"Federal Statistical Office","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/destatis.png\" alt=\" Federal Statistical Office\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ)","source_organisation_2_short":"Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development","source_organisation_logo_2":"<a href=\"https://www.bmz.de/en/index.html\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/bmz.png\" alt=\" Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","history_active_1":true,"history_indicator_1":"15.3.a Preservation or restoration of forests in developing countries under the REDD+ rulebook","history_target_1":"Increase by 2030","history_year_a_1":"2019","history_status_year_a_1":"Sonne","history_year_b_1":"2018","history_status_year_b_1":"Leicht bew\u00f6lkt","history_year_c_1":"2017","history_status_year_c_1":"Sonne","history_year_d_1":"2016","history_status_year_d_1":"Sonne","history_year_e_1":"2015","history_status_year_e_1":"Blitz","history_year_f_1":"2014","history_status_year_f_1":"Leicht bew\u00f6lkt","history_active_2":true,"history_indicator_2":"15.3.b","history_target_2":null,"history_year_a_2":"2019","history_status_year_a_2":"Sonne","history_year_b_2":"2018","history_status_year_b_2":"Sonne","history_year_c_2":"2017","history_status_year_c_2":"Sonne","history_year_d_2":"2016","history_status_year_d_2":"Sonne","history_year_e_2":"2015","history_status_year_e_2":"Sonne","history_year_f_2":"2014","history_status_year_f_2":"Leicht bew\u00f6lkt","data_show_map":null,"data_keywords":null,"data_start_values":[{"field":"Time series","value":"REDD+"},{"field":"Time series","value":"Soil conservation"}],"data_footnote":"Financial contributions prior to 2013 were made in anticipation of the REDD+ rulebook","computation_units":"Millions of euros","copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2021","graph_title":"Payments to developing and emerging countries for the verified preservation or restoration of forests under the REDD+ rulebook","graph_type":"line","graph_min_value":null,"graph_max_value":null,"span_gaps":true,"show_line":true,"stackedBar":null,"national_geographical_coverage":null,"page_content":"<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h3>\n      <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/en/status/\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Sonne.png\" title=\"If the trend continues, the target value will be met or the difference between the target value and the current value will be less than 5&nbsp;%\" alt=\"Weathersymbol\" />\n      </a>\n    </h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"my-header-note\">\n    <span> (Evaluation of the year 2019 as reporting year from indicator report 2021)</span>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h3>\n      <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/en/status/\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Sonne.png\" title=\"If the trend continues, the target value will be met or the difference between the target value and the current value will be less than 5&nbsp;%\" alt=\"Weathersymbol\" />\n      </a>\n    </h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"my-header-note\">\n    <span> (Evaluation of the year 2019 as reporting year from indicator report 2021)</span>\n  </div>\n</div>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-03-25","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-25","indicator_number":"15.3.ab","target_number":"15.3","goal_number":"15","language":"en","postulate":"Preventing deforestation"}
