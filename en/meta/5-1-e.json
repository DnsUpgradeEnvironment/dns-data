These measures include all short, medium and long-term formal and non-formal vocational training programmes in developing and emerging countries. The measures are financed entirely by funds from the federal budget and market funds from \u201cKfW\u201d (the state-owned development bank). After the first survey conducted in 2015 on behalf of the BMZ by the \u201cDeutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH\u201d and the \u201cCentrum f\u00fcr Evaluation GmbH\u201d, the relevant data will be collected at three\u2013year intervals in the future. For this reason, the progress and a possible target achievement of the indicator cannot yet be assessed. No new data have therefore become available since the last indicator report in 2016.<br><br><br><br>Girls and women are reached at different levels by German development assistance, which is why the data were collected at three levels. For measures at individual level, the number of girls and women who received (further) vocational training or participated in targeted guidance programmes can be recorded directly. When it comes to the funding of institutions or funding at policy area level, the number of women and girls in the funded (further) training facilities has to be estimated. In this case, the total number of female trainees in the respective funded (further) training facilities is included at institutional level along with all female trainees in the partner countries at policy area level. Consequently, this may lead to overestimates and multiple counting \u2013 especially at policy area level. Multiple counting of the women and girls reached cannot be ruled out when there are follow-on projects or where several projects are implemented simultaneously in the same region.<br><br><br><br>The value of the indicator is closely related to the funded level as the funding of institutions or policy areas generally reaches more girls and women than individual measures. The indicator does not provide any information on the success, scope and quality of the qualification programmes, which can vary quite considerably. The programmes for promoting the vocational qualifications of girls and women are part of overall official development assistance, which is represented by indicator [17.1](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/17-1-a/).<br><br><br><br>In 2015, 354,841 girls and women were on vocational qualification programmes. 3.6&nbsp;% of these could be reached by direct vocational training programmes. A total of 14.1&nbsp;% of girls and women were reached by institutional funding and 29.9&nbsp;% by programmes at policy area level. Additionally, 50.7&nbsp;% of girls and women were reached through financial cooperation. These measures were not distributed among the three levels mentioned above, and another 1.7&nbsp;% of the girls and women reached could not be assigned.<br><br><br><br>As to the number of programmes, a total of 151 vocational qualification programmes for girls and women were conducted through German development assistance in 2015. Of these, 44.6&nbsp;% were carried out at individual level, 12.0&nbsp;% at institutional level and 8.7&nbsp;% at policy level. Another 28.0&nbsp;% were conducted in the context of financial cooperation, while 6.7&nbsp;% of the measures could not be assigned to individual levels.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ)","source_organisation_1_short":"Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bmz.de/en/index.html\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/bmz.png\" alt=\" Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Centrum f\u00fcr Evaluation GmbH (CEVAL)","source_organisation_2_short":"Centrum f\u00fcr Evaluation GmbH","source_organisation_logo_2":"<a href=\"https://new.ceval.de/modx/en\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/ceval.png\" alt=\" Centrum f\u00fcr Evaluation GmbH\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","source_active_3":true,"source_organisation_3":"Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH","source_organisation_3_short":"Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH","source_organisation_logo_3":"<a href=\"https://www.giz.de/en/html/index.html\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/giz.png\" alt=\" Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","history_active_1":true,"history_indicator_1":"5.1.e","history_target_1":"Increase gradually by one third by 2030 compared with base year 2015","data_show_map":null,"data_keywords":null,"data_start_values":[{"field":"Display","value":"Time series"},{"field":"Display","value":"Target"}],"data_footnote":"The target value is an increase of one third compared with 2015","computation_units":"Thousands","copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2021","graph_title":"Girls and women reached by the vocational qualification programmes of German development assistance","graph_type":"bar","graph_min_value":null,"graph_max_value":null,"span_gaps":true,"show_line":true,"stackedBar":null,"national_geographical_coverage":null,"page_content":"<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h3>\n    </h3>\n  </div>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-07-08","national_data_updated_date":"2022-07-08","indicator_number":"5.1.e","target_number":"5.1","goal_number":"5","language":"en","postulate":"Strengthening the economic participation of women globally"}
