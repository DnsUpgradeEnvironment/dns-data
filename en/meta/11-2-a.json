TREMOD is a model for evaluating traffic emissions. The data include fuel consumption levels within Germany according to the so-called consumption concept, that is, irrespective of the place of fuelling. \u201cFinal energy\u201d refers to the part of the energy used directly during transportation, so this excludes conversion losses that arise during production of fuels as well as possible pipeline losses.<br><br><br><br>The transport performances in goods transport used to calculate the specific energy consumption in this sector are computed by the ifeu on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure. Road goods transport takes into account transports on lorries with payloads in excess of 3.5 tonnes. However, goods transport by air is not included as it accounts for negligibly small volumes.<br><br><br><br>The indicator for final energy consumption in goods transport refers by definition to consumption within Germany. The influence of the German economy\u2019s increasingly international links in the context of globalisation are reflected only to an insufficient degree. As a result, transport flows and the associated energy consumption that arises due to German exports and imports are not included.<br><br><br><br>In addition to energy consumption, energy efficiency, i.e. energy consumption per tonne-kilometre, is also presented. The number of tonne-kilometres provides information about the extent to which transport intensity, or the distance per transported tonne, changes.<br><br><br><br>Contrary to the targeted goal of the Federal Government, final energy consumption for the carriage of goods in 2016 increased by 10.0&nbsp;% compared to 2005. This sharp increase can be attributed primarily to goods transport by road. Final energy consumption for road goods transport increased during this period by 12.2&nbsp;%, while consumption for rail and inland waterways transport was considerably reduced (\u2013 8.5% and \u2013 17.8% respectively).<br><br><br><br>During the same period, the goods transport performance increased by 12.9&nbsp;%. With similar energy consumption in 2005 and 2016, efficiency increased markedly by 2.5&nbsp;% during this period.<br><br><br><br>During the financial and economic crisis of 2009, price-adjusted gross value added in manufacturing suffered a particularly sharp decline of nearly 20&nbsp;%. This heavy loss affected the transport sector in particular, which reacts directly to increases and decreases in the production of goods. The resulting lower utilisation of transport capacity explains the slight increase in average energy consumption per tonne-kilometre, despite the fact that overall energy consumption fell sharply during the crisis years.<br><br><br><br>Besides the presumably short-term consequences of the financial and economic crisis of 2009, a number of long-term factors also influenced the development of final energy consumption in goods transport during the review period between 2005 and 2016. For instance, the number of production steps per company has decreased, something that is normally associated with greater transport volumes because companies procure more intermediate goods from domestic and international suppliers. Furthermore, the average distance between the production location for the goods and their place of use increased, which also caused transport volumes to increase. These effects are countered by a shift in the demand structure towards less material-intensive goods (e. g. an increasing demand for services). The resulting change in the composition of the volume of goods dampened the increase in transport-related energy consumption.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"German Institute for Energy and Environmental Research (IFEU)","source_organisation_1_short":"German Institute for Energy and Environmental Research","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.ifeu.de/en/\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/ifeu.png\" alt=\" German Institute for Energy and Environmental Research\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Federal Statistical Office (Destatis)","source_organisation_2_short":"Federal Statistical Office","source_organisation_logo_2":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/destatis.png\" alt=\" Federal Statistical Office\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","history_active_1":true,"history_indicator_1":"11.2.a Final energy consumption in goods transport","history_target_1":"Reduce by 15 to 20&nbsp;% by 2030","history_year_a_1":"2018","history_status_year_a_1":"Blitz","history_year_b_1":"2017","history_status_year_b_1":"Blitz","history_year_c_1":"2016","history_status_year_c_1":"Blitz","history_year_d_1":"2015","history_status_year_d_1":"Blitz","history_year_e_1":"2014","history_status_year_e_1":"Blitz","history_year_f_1":"2013","history_status_year_f_1":"Sonne","history_year_g_1":"2012","history_status_year_g_1":"Sonne","data_show_map":null,"data_keywords":null,"data_start_values":[{"field":"Display","value":"Time series"},{"field":"Display","value":"Target"},{"field":"Time series","value":"Final energy consumption for the carriage of goods"}],"data_footnote":null,"computation_units":"2005 = 100","copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2021","graph_title":"Final energy consumption in goods transport","graph_type":"line","graph_min_value":70.0,"graph_max_value":130.0,"stackedBar":null,"national_geographical_coverage":"Germany","page_content":"<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h3>\n      <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/en/status/\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Blitz.png\" title=\"The indicator is not moving in the right direction so that the gap to the target value is widening\" alt=\"Weathersymbol\" />\n      </a>\n    </h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"my-header-note\">\n    <span> (Evaluation of the year 2018 as reporting year from indicator report 2021)</span>\n  </div>\n</div>","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-03-25: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/DnsTestEnvironment/dns-data/commit/ca7427fe694b171b6bd2982b39db4bffaa04a759","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-03-25: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/DnsTestEnvironment/dns-data/commit/f72ad64f6280dee307fa9b8113abb3e2fc724bc4","language":"en"}
