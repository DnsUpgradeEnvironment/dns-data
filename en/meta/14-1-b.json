Therefore, the number of fish stocks that are sustainably managed based on the MSY approach should always be viewed in relation to overall fish stocks. Although an expansion of the investigation to include as many stocks as possible is desirable, the high cost of these investigations means that the prospect of recording all stocks, even those that are economically less relevant and less fished, is unrealistic.<br><br><br><br>Based on current estimates, a total of 58 fish stocks in the North Sea and 20 stocks in the Baltic Sea are used for economic purposes. The number of stocks examined using the MSY approach is currently 8 in the Baltic Sea and 22 in the North Sea. This means that only a third of all managed stocks are fully analysed with respect to sustainable management. All other stocks for which the data available are not sufficient for analysis according to the MSY method are not included in this indicator.<br><br><br><br>A stock is considered to be \u201csustainably managed\u201d if the actual amount of fish caught per year and the fish stock do not exceed the scientifically recommended amount based on the MSY approach, or if they comply with the requirements of a long-term management plan assessed as sustainable according to the MSY approach. In this context, a \u201cfish stock\u201c is defined as an independently reproducing population of a specific species of fish. A specific species can therefore have multiple stocks and, depending on the stock, can also have different guideline values regarding the amount of fish caught. As a rule, each stock is assigned a guideline value according to its previous development.<br><br><br><br>The guideline values for the managed stocks are calculated by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES).<br><br><br><br>The annual calculation of the amounts of fish caught sustainably according to the MSY approach is based on stochastic predictions, which use calculations of historical stock trends. Information about fish quantities landed is based on reported catches. Samples taken from this provide insights into the demographic parameters of the population, such as age and size. Other important sources of information on the state of fish stocks are scientific surveys conducted on research vessels that are independent of the fishing industry.<br><br><br><br>In 2016, the sustainably managed stocks of fish accounted for 56.7&nbsp;% of the total stocks examined in accordance with the MSY approach in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The relevant proportions were 59.1&nbsp;% in the North Sea and 50.0&nbsp;% in the Baltic Sea.<br><br><br><br>Regarding the development between 2011 and 2016, the overall progress was positive. In 2012 and 2014, however, the proportion of sustainably managed fish stocks was lower compared with the previous year. It is difficult to assess the indicator because it is influenced in addition to the development of the stocks, also by the selection of stocks to be considered. Thus, the basis of assessment can vary from year to year, which makes it difficult to compare the results of individual years. In addition, the recommended amounts of fish caught apply across countries and therefore can only be fulfilled indirectly by the efforts of a single country alone.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"European Commission","source_organisation_1_short":"European Commission","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/index_de\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logos/europeancommission.png\" alt=\" European Commission\" title=\"Klicken Sie hier um zu der Homepage der Organisation zu gelangen\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","history_active_1":true,"history_indicator_1":"14.1.b Proportion of sustainably fished stocks of fish in the North and the Baltic Sea","history_target_1":"Manage sustainably all fish stocks used for economic purposes in accordance with the MSY approach by 2020","history_year_a_1":"2018","history_status_year_a_1":"Wolke","history_year_b_1":"2017","history_status_year_b_1":"Blitz","history_year_c_1":"2016","history_status_year_c_1":"Wolke","history_year_d_1":"2015","history_status_year_d_1":"Wolke","history_year_e_1":"2014","history_status_year_e_1":"Wolke","history_year_f_1":"2013","history_status_year_f_1":"Wolke","history_year_g_1":"2012","history_status_year_g_1":"Leicht bew\u00f6lkt","data_show_map":null,"data_keywords":null,"data_start_values":[{"field":"Display","value":"Time series"},{"field":"Display","value":"Target"},{"field":"Time series","value":"Proportion of sustainable managed stocks in all MSY examined stocks"}],"data_footnote":null,"computation_units":"Percent","copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2021","graph_title":"Sustainably fished stocks of fish in the North and the Baltic Sea as a proportion of all MSY examined stocks","graph_type":"bar","graph_min_value":null,"graph_max_value":null,"span_gaps":true,"show_line":true,"stackedBar":null,"national_geographical_coverage":"Entire North Sea and Baltic Sea","page_content":"<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h3>\n      <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/en/status/\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Wolke.png\" title=\"The indicator is moving in the right direction but if the trend continues, the target value will be missed by more than 20&nbsp;% in the target year\" alt=\"Weathersymbol\" />\n      </a>\n    </h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"my-header-note\">\n    <span> (Evaluation of the year 2018 as reporting year from indicator report 2021)</span>\n  </div>\n</div>","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-03-25: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/DnsTestEnvironment/dns-data/commit/b4b3ae10cb9c9e9f1775068849e8e18341dd5d17","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-03-25: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/DnsTestEnvironment/dns-data/commit/f72ad64f6280dee307fa9b8113abb3e2fc724bc4","language":"en","postulate":"Protecting and sustainably using oceans and marine resources"}
