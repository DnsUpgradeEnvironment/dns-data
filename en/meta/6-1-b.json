It is part of the water cycle and performs important ecological functions. Groundwater is also Germany\u2019s most important drinking water resource. However, elevated nitrate content impairs the ecology of bodies of water. The threshold of 50&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\">mg/l</abbr> of nitrate in groundwater specified in the Ground Water Ordinance and in the Surface Waters Ordinance are therefore to be observed at all monitoring sites by 2030.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of 31.10.2022. The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/publications/reports/en/2022.pdf\">indicator report 2022</a>.","indicator_name":"Nitrate in groundwater","section":"Water quality","postulate":"Reduction of substance pollution in water","target_id":"6.1.1","previous":"6-1-a","next":"6-2-ab","content_and_progress":"<i>Text from the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/publications/reports/en/2022.pdf\">Indicator Report 2022&nbsp;</a></i><br><br>The nitrate content in groundwater is collected by the L\u00e4nder for the purpose of reporting on the status of groundwater in Germany to the European Environment Agency (<abbr title=\"European Environment Agency\">EEA</abbr>). The monitoring sites used for this purpose together form the so-called <abbr title=\"European Environment Agency\">EEA</abbr> monitoring network. The <abbr title=\"European Environment Agency\">EEA</abbr> monitoring network comprises a total of 1214&nbsp;monitoring sites and provides a representative picture of Germany. The data are compiled by the Federal Environment Agency from information provided by the German Working Group on Water Issues of the L\u00e4nder and the Federal Government (<abbr title=\"German Working Group on Water Issues of the L\u00e4nder and the Federal Government\">LAWA</abbr>).<br><br>Like the indicator of phosphorus content in flowing waters, the nitrate indicator does not reveal how far above or below the threshold the readings have been. The indicator merely records how many of all the monitoring sites complied with the prescribed threshold. The nitrate load may have fallen sharply at some monitoring sites. Nevertheless, if the concentration remains above the maximum of 50&nbsp;mg/l, the reduction will not be reflected in the indicator.<br><br>The same applies to nitrate loads that have increased but are still below the threshold. The interpretation must also take into account that measures to reduce nitrate pollution may have a delayed effect, since the period of infiltration from the surface to the groundwater can take several years.<br><br>The naturally occurring level of nitrate lies between 0&nbsp;and 10&nbsp;mg/l. Concentrations between 10&nbsp;and 25&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\">mg/l</abbr> indicate minor to medium loads. Concentrations between 25&nbsp;and 50&nbsp;milligrams per liter indicate severe groundwater contamination. Figures above the threshold of 50&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\">mg/l</abbr> which is set in the Ground Water Ordinance and which also underlies this indicator mean that the groundwater has a poor chemical status and cannot be used as drinking water without treatment.<br><br>In 2018&nbsp;the target of less than 50&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams\">mg</abbr> of nitrate per litre was met at 82.7&nbsp;of all monitoring sites. Since 2008, the percentage of monitoring sites at which this target is met has remained virtually unchanged. This means that the goal of recording concentrations below the threshold at all monitoring sites has not been achieved and that the indicator value is not recognisably moving in that direction. Conversely, in 2018&nbsp;the nitrate threshold of 50&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\">mg/l</abbr> was exceeded at 17.3% of the groundwater monitoring sites in the <abbr title=\"European Environment Agency\">EEA</abbr> monitoring network. Consequently, the groundwater at these locations cannot be used for drinking-water supplies without treatment. At 17.3% of the monitoring sites the nitrate value lay between 25&nbsp;and 50&nbsp;mg/l, which still indicates an elevated degree of pollution. This percentage rate also remained virtually unchanged over the years.<br><br>The pollution of groundwater with nitrate is caused primarily by the leaching of nitrate from various nitrogen fertilisers. Besides farmyard manures such as liquid manure and slurry, these also include the mineral fertilisers that are used in intensive crop-farming. The last few years have also seen an increase in the use of digestate, which occurs as a by-product of biogas power plants, as an agricultural fertiliser. All of these things can contribute to higher nitrate values in groundwater if fertilisation is not matched to specific crop requirements. Accordingly, the development of indicator 2.1.a \u2013 Nitrogen surplus in agriculture \u2013 influences the nitrate load in groundwater.<br><br>In order to measure the actual influence of agricultural activity on the nitrate load of waters, there is a separate system of nitrate reporting to the <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr>. For this report, the monitoring sites for waters in predominantly agricultural catchment areas are selected from the <abbr title=\"European Environment Agency\">EEA</abbr> site network. The nitrate load in that specific part of the monitoring network is therefore above the average for indicator 6.1.b.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\">German Environment Agency</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\">German Environment Agency</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\"><img src=\"https://dnsUpgradeEnvironment.github.io/dns-indicators/public/OrgImgEn/uba.png\" alt=\"German Environment Agency\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationGerman Environment Agency\" style=\"height:60px;
