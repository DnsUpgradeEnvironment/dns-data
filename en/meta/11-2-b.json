For instance, noise and air pollutants impair the quality of life especially in cities, and traffic-related emissions contribute to climate change. The emission of harmful greenhouse gases is linked to the energy consumed for transport purposes. Therefore, final energy consumption in passenger transport is to be reduced by 15 to 20&nbsp;% by 2030.","data_state":"Der Indikatorenbericht 2021 hat den Datenstand 31.12.2020.

TREMOD is a model for evaluating traffic emissions. The data include fuel consumption levels associated with passenger transport within Germany according to the consumption concept, that is, irrespective of where fuelling takes place. \u201cFinal energy\u201d refers to the part of the energy used directly during transportation, so this excludes conversion losses that arise during production of fuels as well as possible pipeline losses.<br><br><br><br>Passenger transport performance specifies the number of passenger-kilometres covered. It is used to calculate the specific energy consumption in this sector and is computed by the ifeu on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure. For air transport, only domestic flights (national aviation) are taken into account. International flights to and from the federal territory are not included. The carriage of passengers by ship is not included, either.<br><br><br><br>Nearly 30&nbsp;% of overall final energy consumption can be attributed to transport. Savings in final energy consumption in passenger transport therefore have a marked effect on total energy consumption in Germany. The number of passenger-kilometres provides information about the extent to which transport intensity (distance per road/rail or air passenger numbers) changes. In addition to final energy consumption, energy efficiency in passenger transport, measured as energy consumption per passenger-kilometre, is examined.<br><br><br><br>Final energy consumption in passenger transport decreased by a total of 1.1&nbsp;% in the period from 2005 to 2016. Analysis of the progress since 2008 reveals that the indicator value increased by 1.7&nbsp;%. Thus final energy consumption in passenger transport is currently developing in a direction which opposes the goal of the German Sustainability Strategy.<br><br><br><br>Although the number of passenger-kilometres covered increased by 10.5&nbsp;% between 2005 and 2016, energy consumption in all forms of transport decreased by 10.5&nbsp;% to 1.43 megajoules per passenger-kilometre during the same period. Consequently, efficiency in passenger transport increased notably. A particularly large share of the efficiency increase can be attributed torail transport. Here, transport performance increased by 24.7&nbsp;%, while final energy consumption was successfully reduced by 11.2&nbsp;%. This was a 28.8&nbsp;% increase in efficiency. A considerable increase in efficiency of 13.9&nbsp;% was also achieved in air transport compared to 2005. A slight improvement in the efficiency of private motorised transport was recently achieved due to an increased transport performance, eventhough energy consumption remained constant.<br><br><br><br>Private motorised transport by car and two-wheel vehicles accounted for 83.7&nbsp;% of total passenger transport performance in 2015. In 2016 it was 83.6%. This mode of transport can be subdivided into different categories. In 2015 (more recent data were not yet available), transport for recreational purposes accounted for the largest share (35.4&nbsp;%), closely followed by work-related transport (commuting and business trips) with 34.5&nbsp;%. Transport for shopping purposes accounted for 17.5%. The various transport purposes have developed differently since 2005. In particular, the proportion of work-related journeys has increased considerably (+ 15.6&nbsp;%), while holiday journeys have declined (\u2013 1.6&nbsp;%).","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"German Institute for Energy and Environmental Research (IFEU)","source_organisation_1_short":"German Institute for Energy and Environmental Research","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.ifeu.de/en/\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/ifeu.png\" alt=\" German Institute for Energy and Environmental Research\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Federal Statistical Office (Destatis)","source_organisation_2_short":"Federal Statistical Office","source_organisation_logo_2":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/destatis.png\" alt=\" Federal Statistical Office\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","history_active_1":true,"history_indicator_1":"11.2.b Final energy consumption in passenger transport","history_target_1":"Reduce by 15 to 20&nbsp;% by 2030","history_year_a_1":"2018","history_status_year_a_1":"Blitz","history_year_b_1":"2017","history_status_year_b_1":"Blitz","history_year_c_1":"2016","history_status_year_c_1":"Wolke","history_year_d_1":"2015","history_status_year_d_1":"Wolke","history_year_e_1":"2014","history_status_year_e_1":"Blitz","history_year_f_1":"2013","history_status_year_f_1":"Blitz","history_year_g_1":"2012","history_status_year_g_1":"Wolke","data_show_map":null,"data_keywords":null,"data_start_values":[{"field":"Display","value":"Time series"},{"field":"Display","value":"Target"},{"field":"Time series","value":"Passenger transport performance"},{"field":"Time series","value":"Final energy consumption per passenger-kilometre"},{"field":"Time series","value":"Final energy consumption in passenger transport"}],"data_footnote":null,"computation_units":"2005 = 100","copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2021","graph_title":"Final energy consumption in passenger transport","graph_type":"line","graph_min_value":70.0,"graph_max_value":120.0,"span_gaps":true,"show_line":true,"stackedBar":null,"national_geographical_coverage":"Germany","page_content":"<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h3>\n      <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/en/status/\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Blitz.png\" title=\"The indicator is not moving in the right direction so that the gap to the target value is widening\" alt=\"Weathersymbol\" />\n      </a>\n    </h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"my-header-note\">\n    <span> (Evaluation of the year 2018 as reporting year from indicator report 2021)</span>\n  </div>\n</div>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-07-08","national_data_updated_date":"2022-07-08","indicator_number":"11.2.b","target_number":"11.2","goal_number":"11","language":"en","postulate":"Guaranteeing mobility \u2013 Protecting the environment"}
