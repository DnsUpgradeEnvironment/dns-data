As data availability is uncertain, the Alpine habitat is currently not taken into account.<br><br><br><br>The population size per species is calculated annually from the results of bird monitoring programmes by the Dachverband Deutscher Avifaunisten (DDA) in cooperation with the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (BfN) and is set in relation to the size of the target population. The value of the target population was determined by a committee of experts for each bird species - originally for the year 2015. The historical values for 1970 and 1975 have been recalculated.<br><br><br><br>For each sub-indicator, the arithmetic mean of the degrees of target achievement is calculated for all ten or eleven selected bird species. The overall indicator is calculated as a weighted sum of the sub-indicators. The weighting is based on the respective main habitat or landscape type as a share of the total area of Germany. For the time being, the target values for the sub-indicators and the overall indicator were not altered for the target year 2030.<br><br><br><br>In addition to birds, there are also other species that rely on a richly structured landscape with intact, sustainably used habitats, which means that the indicator also indirectly maps the development of a number of other species in the landscape and the sustainability of land use.<br><br><br><br>In 1990, the value of the indicator \u201dBiodiversity and landscape quality\u201d was considerably lower than the values recalculated for 1970 and 1975. In the last ten reference years (2005 to 2015), the value of the indicator has deteriorated further. In 2015, it was 70.3&nbsp;% of the target value. Should this development continue, the target set for 2030 is unlikely to be achieved.<br><br><br><br>In the course of the last ten years (from 2005 to 2015), however, the sub-indicators for the individual habitat types have developed differently. Up to 2014, the sub-indicators for farmland (2015: 59.2&nbsp;% of the target value) as well as for coasts and seas (2015: 58.5&nbsp;% of the target value) showed a downward development, but have recovered slightly in 2015. This also has a considerable impact on the value of the overall indicator.<br><br><br><br>Except for the sub-indicators for forests and inland waters, all sub-indicators also remained considerably below the comparative values for 1990. In terms of biodiversity and the landscape quality of forests, the situation appeared to have improved considerably recently in comparison with the other habitat types. In 2015, this habitat achieved 90.1&nbsp;% of the target value, which was the highest value compared with the other sub-indicators.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (BFN)","source_organisation_1_short":"Federal Agency for Nature Conservation","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bfn.de/en.html\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/bfn.png\" alt=\" Federal Agency for Nature Conservation\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_1":"https://www.bfn.de/themen/monitoring/indikatoren/indikator-artenvielfalt-und-landschaftsqualitaet.html","source_url_text_1":null,"history_active_1":true,"history_indicator_1":"15.1 Biodiversity and landscape quality","history_target_1":"Increase to an index value of 100 by 2030","history_year_a_1":"2016","history_status_year_a_1":"Wolke","history_year_b_1":"2015","history_status_year_b_1":"Wolke","history_year_c_1":"2014","history_status_year_c_1":"Blitz","history_year_d_1":"2013","history_status_year_d_1":"Blitz","history_year_e_1":"2012","history_status_year_e_1":"Wolke","history_year_f_1":"2011","history_status_year_f_1":"Blitz","history_year_g_1":"2010","history_status_year_g_1":"Blitz","data_show_map":null,"data_keywords":null,"data_start_values":[{"field":"Display","value":"Time series"},{"field":"Display","value":"Target"},{"field":"Time series","value":"Index overall"},{"field":"Time series","value":"Sub-index forests"},{"field":"Time series","value":"Sub-index settlements"},{"field":"Time series","value":"Sub-index farmland"},{"field":"Time series","value":"Sub-index inland waters"},{"field":"Time series","value":"Sub-index coasts/seas"}],"data_footnote":"The sub-indicator for the Alps is currently suspended across the entire data series.
