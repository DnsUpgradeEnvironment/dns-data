The guiding principle of the structurally balanced budget has also been enshrined in Germany\u2019s Basic Law since 2009 (Article 109, referred to as the debt brake).","data_state":"Der Indikatorenbericht 2021 hat den Datenstand 31.12.2020.

Whereas the structural financial balance is determined by the Federal Ministry of Finance. The calculation of the government deficit takes into account the finances of the territorial authorities, that is, central, state and local government (Federation, L\u00e4nder and municipalities), and the finances of the social security funds. Additional units (so-called extra budgets) \u2013 such as the German Financial Market Stabilisation Fund, which must be allocated to the general government sector according to the ESA \u2013 are also included. The values are based mainly on the financial results of the federal budget according to information provided by the Federal Ministry of Finance and, for state and local government, on the quarterly cash results of public finance statistics.<br><br><br><br>In 2014, total general government reported a surplus of 16.7 billion euros \u2013 the first positive result since the financial market and economic crisis in 2008/2009. In 2017 the financial surplus amounted to 34.0 billion euros. The central government (Federation) surplus was 6.1 billion euros. At the same time, the state government (L\u00e4nder) again reported a surplus ([8.3](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/8-3-a/) billion euros). The results from local government (municipalities) (9.5 billion euros) and the social security funds ([10.1](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/10-1-a/) billion euros) were also positive. The overall government budget in 2017 showed a structural surplus of 1.5&nbsp;% (provisional results) of GDP. As a result, the Maastricht Criteria of the EU regarding the government deficit as well as the structural deficit have been met since 2012.<br><br><br><br>Viewed over the entire period from 1991 to 2017, government revenue grew more strongly (116.0&nbsp;%) than GDP at current prices (107.5&nbsp;%) and expenditure (96.6&nbsp;%). Consequently, the share of government revenue in GDP increased from 43.2&nbsp;% to 45.0&nbsp;%. However, higher revenue growth became apparent only from 2011 onwards.<br><br><br><br>Expenditure showed a disproportionate increase in social benefits in kind. These have increased by 176.7&nbsp;% since 1991, whereas the largest item on the expenditure side \u2013social benefits other than social transfers in kind \u2013 recorded an increase of 114.9&nbsp;%, which was only slightly higher than GDP growth (107.5&nbsp;%). Around 70&nbsp;% of social benefits other than social transfers in kind are accounted for by social security funds, primarily in the form of pensions and unemployment benefits. From 2003 onwards, the social benefits other than social transfers in kind fell from 18.4&nbsp;% of GDP to 15.4&nbsp;%, which can be primarily attributed to sharp reductions in unemployment insurance payments. These fell by roughly 24 billion euros between 2003 and 2017 as a result of the Hartz legislation and an upturn in the labour market.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Federal Statistical Office (Destatis)","source_organisation_1_short":"Federal Statistical Office","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/destatis.png\" alt=\" Federal Statistical Office\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_1":"https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Wirtschaft/Volkswirtschaftliche-Gesamtrechnungen-Inlandsprodukt/Tabellen/eu-stabilitaetspakt-defizit-staat.html","source_url_text_1":null,"source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF)","source_organisation_2_short":"Federal Ministry of Finance","source_organisation_logo_2":"<a href=\"https://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Web/EN/Home/home.html\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/bmf.png\" alt=\" Federal Ministry of Finance\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","history_active_1":true,"history_indicator_1":"8.2.a Government deficit","history_target_1":"Annual government deficit less than 3&nbsp;% of GDP, to be continued up to 2030","history_year_a_1":"2019","history_status_year_a_1":"Sonne","history_year_b_1":"2018","history_status_year_b_1":"Sonne","history_year_c_1":"2017","history_status_year_c_1":"Sonne","history_year_d_1":"2016","history_status_year_d_1":"Sonne","history_year_e_1":"2015","history_status_year_e_1":"Sonne","history_year_f_1":"2014","history_status_year_f_1":"Sonne","history_year_g_1":"2013","history_status_year_g_1":"Sonne","history_active_2":true,"history_indicator_2":"8.2.b Structural deficit","history_target_2":"Structurally balanced government budget, general government structural deficit must not exceed 0.5&nbsp;% of GDP, to be continued up to 2030","history_year_a_2":"2019","history_status_year_a_2":"Leicht bew\u00f6lkt","history_year_b_2":"2018","history_status_year_b_2":"Sonne","history_year_c_2":"2017","history_status_year_c_2":"Sonne","history_year_d_2":"2016","history_status_year_d_2":"Sonne","history_year_e_2":"2015","history_status_year_e_2":"Sonne","history_year_f_2":"2014","history_status_year_f_2":"Sonne","history_year_g_2":"2013","history_status_year_g_2":"Sonne","data_show_map":null,"data_keywords":null,"data_start_values":[{"field":"Display","value":"Time series"},{"field":"Display","value":"Target"},{"field":"Time series","value":"Funding balance (share of gross domestic product (at current prices))"},{"field":"Time series","value":"Structural funding balance (share of gross domestic product (at current prices))"},{"field":"Time series","value":"Gross domestic produkt (price-adjusted) (year-on-year changes)"}],"data_footnote":"Previous year's prices chain-linked, 2015 = 100","computation_units":"Balances: Percentage share of gross domestic product (at current prices);
