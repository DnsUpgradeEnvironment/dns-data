The public financial balance is calculated as government revenue minus government expenditure, measured on a national accounts basis. The annual structural balance refers to the part of the financial balance that is not attributable to cyclical fluctuations and temporary effects.","dns_indicator_intention":"Sound public finances are an essential element of a sustainable fiscal policy. A policy that relies too heavily on borrowing to fund current public expenditure and then passes this debt on to future generations is simply not sustainable.<br>According to the convergence criteria for the European Union, known as the Maastricht criteria, the annual government deficit should be less than 3% of GDP. The structural deficit must not exceed 0.5% of GDP. These are the stipulations of the European Stability and Growth Pact. The guiding principle of the structurally balanced budget has also been enshrined in Germany\u2019s Basic Law since 2009 (Article 109, referred to as the debt brake).","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2021 is as of 31.12.2020.

The structural financial balance, on the other hand, is determined by the Federal Ministry of Finance. The calculation of government net borrowing takes into account the finances of the public authorities, that is to say the Federal Government, the L\u00e4nder and local government, and the finances of the social insurance system.<br>In contrast to the previous indicator report, the national accounts calculations were reviewed and revised in 2019 as part of their periodic major revision, and the reference year was changed to 2015. As a result, nominal GDP figures are slightly lower on average than they were before the major revision of 2019. The overall economic picture, however, has remained largely unchanged.<br>In 2012, the Government achieved an overall surplus of EUR 0.3 billion, which was the first positive balance since the financial and economic crisis of 2008/2009. In 2019, the financial surplus amounted to EUR 52.5 billion and 1.5% of GDP (preliminary data). The federal surplus came to EUR 22.7 billion. At the same time, L\u00e4nder yet again recorded an aggregate surplus (EUR 16.4 billion). The balances for local government (EUR 5.1 billion) and the social insurance fund (EUR 8.7 billion) were also positive. The national budget in 2019 showed a structural surplus of 0.6% of GDP (preliminary data). This meant that the EU convergence criteria for both the government deficit and the structural deficit had been met ever since 2012.<br>Given the economic repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic and the government support measures, however, bodies such as the German Council of Economic Experts are already forecasting a negative financial balance in the forthcoming accounts for the 2020 and 2021 reporting years. This development has not yet been factored into the current status calculation and so has had no bearing on the displayed weather symbol. A valid assessment will not be possible until the figures for 2020 have been presented.<br>Over the entire period from 1991 to 2019 the growth of government revenue (134.7%) exceeded that of GDP (117.5%) at current prices as well as expenditure growth (111.4%). Government revenue as a proportion of GDP therefore increased from 43.3% to 46.7%.<br>The largest item on the expenditure side of the national accounts is monetary social benefits. These rose by 131.5% from 1991 to 2019, thus exceeding the GDP growth rate of 117.5%. Around 70% of monetary social benefits fall under the heading of social insurance, primarily in the form of pensions and unemployment benefits. As a proportion of GDP, monetary social benefits fell from 18.5% in 2003 to 15.8% in 2019, which is chiefly due to a steep decline in payments from the unemployment insurance fund. These payments fell by about EUR 22.6 billion between 2003 and 2019 as a result of the Hartz welfare legislation and an upturn in the job market.","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"8.2.a Staatsdefizit","weather_indicator_1_target":"J\u00e4hrliches Staatsdefizit kleiner als 3 % des BIP, Beibehaltung bis 2030","weather_active_2":true,"weather_indicator_2":"8.2.b Strukturelles Defizit","weather_indicator_2_target":"Strukturell ausgeglichener Staatshaushalt, gesamtstaatliches strukturelles Defizit von max. 0,5 % des BIP, Beibehaltung bis 2030","data_show_map":false,"copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2022","footer_fileds":[{"label":"Note","value":"Previous years\u2019 prices chain-linked, 2015 = 100.
