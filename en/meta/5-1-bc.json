The same applies to the percentage of women in management positions in the federal civil service. For this reason, the share of women on supervisory boards of listed and fully co-determined companies is to be increased to 30% by 2030. Under the bill for a Second Gender Equality (Management Positions) Act, which the Cabinet adopted on 6 January 2021, equal representation of women and men in management positions in the civil service is to be achieved by 2025. This will fulfil one of the commitments made in the coalition agreement of 2018.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2021 is as of 31.12.2020.

The data basis for the indicator comprises the publications of listed and fully co-determined companies, which are analysed by the Frauen in die Aufsichtsr\u00e4te (Women on Board) association and published in the form of a WOB index.<br>In January 2020, women\u2019s share of positions on the supervisory boards of these companies came to about 35.2%. In January 2015, it was still only 21.3%. The target of 30% was reached in 2018, which was twelve years in advance of the deadline set in the German Sustainable Development Strategy. The Gender Equality (Management Positions) Act prescribed that, in cases where elections were held for positions on the supervisory boards of the companies defined above in or after 2016, at least 30% of the seats on those boards must be occupied by women, and so compliance with the Act could be expected to yield this increase.<br>Given the definition used for the indicator, most of the businesses in Germany and the majority of management positions in the private sector are not taken into account. At the present time, the reported and analysed data relate to a group of 105 companies. The positions on supervisory boards that the WOB association has examined to date, fewer than 1,600 in number, are but a small fraction of the total of 882,000 management positions in the private sector identified by the pay structure survey in 2018. The figures show clearly that focusing on the supervisory board of a company reveals only some of the management positions in that company.<br>According to the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO), managers are all persons who plan, direct, coordinate and evaluate the overall activities of enterprises, governments and other organisations, or of organisational units within them, and formulate and review their policies, laws, rules and regulations. This definition includes the activities of supervisory boards. If the ISCO classification is used as a basis, 22% of the 882,000 management positions in businesses were held by women in 2018. This figure is reached by considering all businesses with at least one employee for whom compulsory social insurance contributions are payable, excluding entities in sector O \u2013 Public administration and defence; compulsory social security \u2013 and parts of sector P \u2013 Education. Compared with 2014, the year of the previous pay structure survey, this represents an increase of 1.2 percentage points.<br><b><i>Percentage of women in management positions in the federal civil service</i></b><br>The data basis for this indicator comprises the internal gender equality statistics collected by all offices of the federal government pursuant to the Federal Gender Equality Act. Since 2015, these statistics have been compiled every second year, updated to 30 June, by the Federal Statistical Office on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth. Before then they were compiled annually.<br>In 2019, according to preliminary data, the proportion of women in management positions in the federal civil service was about 37.6%. In 2000, the indicator value was 19.5%. This represents a 92.8% increase in the proportion of women since 2000. If the trend of the last five years were maintained, the target of virtual numerical equality in management positions in the federal civil service by 2025 would be narrowly missed.<br>The indicator is focused on the employees in management positions in all departments of the federal government. Their number includes all persons employed on a full-time or part-time basis as well as those who have been given leave of absence on grounds of family or c","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.fidar.de/\">Frauen in die Aufsichtsr\u00e4te e.V.</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.fidar.de/\">Frauen in die Aufsichtsr\u00e4te e.V.</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.fidar.de/\"><img src=\"ttps://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/fidar.png\" alt=\"Frauen in die Aufsichtsr\u00e4te e.V.\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFrauen in die Aufsichtsr\u00e4te e.V.\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_1":"https://www.fidar.de/wob-indizes-studien/wob-index-185/studie-zum-wob-index-185.html","source_url_text_1":"Study on the WoB Index (only available in German)","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_2_short":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_2":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\"><img src=\"ttps://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/destatis.png\" alt=\"Federal Statistical Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Statistical Office\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"5.1.b On supervisory boards of listed and fully co-determined companies","weather_indicator_1_year_a":"2021","weather_indicator_1_year_b":"2020","weather_indicator_1_target":"30% women on supervisory boards of listed and fully co-determined companies by 2030","weather_indicator_1_item_a":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_item_b":"Sonne","weather_active_2":true,"weather_indicator_2":"5.1.c In management positions in the federal civil service","weather_indicator_2_year_a":"2021","weather_indicator_2_year_b":"2019","weather_indicator_2_year_c":"2017","weather_indicator_2_year_d":"2015","weather_indicator_2_year_e":"2014","weather_indicator_2_year_f":"2013","weather_indicator_2_year_g":"2012","weather_indicator_2_target":"Equal-opportunity participation of women and men in civil service management positions by 2025","weather_indicator_2_item_a":"Leicht bew\u00f6lkt","weather_indicator_2_item_b":"Leicht bew\u00f6lkt","weather_indicator_2_item_c":"Wolke","weather_indicator_2_item_d":"Wolke","weather_indicator_2_item_e":"Wolke","weather_indicator_2_item_f":"Wolke","weather_indicator_2_item_g":"Wolke","data_show_map":false,"copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2022","data_footnotes":"In this context, equal representation means that approximately numerical equality is targeted.<br>\u2022 <br>\u2022 Women on supervisory boards: figures as at January each year.<br>\u2022 <br>\u2022 Women in management positions in the federal civil service: figures as at 30 June each year.<br>\u2022 <br>\u2022 2021 provisional data.","graph_title":"Share of women in management positions","graph_annotations":[{"value":30.0,"label":{"content":"indicator.target_annotation_5_1_b_2030","position":"left"},"preset":"target_line"},{"value":45.0,"label":{"content":"indicator.target_annotation_5_1_c_2025","position":"left"},"preset":"target_line"}],"span_gaps":true,"show_line":true,"graph_type":"line","data_start_values":[{"field":"Time series","value":"In management positions in the federal civil service"},{"field":"Time series","value":"On supervisory boards of listed and fully co-determined companies"}],"national_geographical_coverage":"Germany","page_content":"\n\n<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h3>b) Business\n      <a href=\"https://dnsTestEnvironment.github.io/dns-indicators/en/status\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Sonne.png\" title=\"Text will follow soon\" alt=\"Wettersymbol\"/>\n      </a>\n    </h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"my-header-note\">\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h3>c) Federal civil service\n      <a href=\"https://dnsTestEnvironment.github.io/dns-indicators/en/status\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Leicht bew\u00f6lkt.png\" title=\"Text will follow soon\" alt=\"Wettersymbol\"/>\n      </a>\n    </h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"my-header-note\">\n  </div>\n</div>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-08-22","national_data_updated_date":"2022-08-22","indicator_number":"5.1.bc","target_number":"5.1","goal_number":"5","language":"en"}
