Thus the goal of Germany being involved in a minimum of 15 projects would have been achieved in 2012 for the first time. Except for 2013, the level would have been reached or even exceeded in subsequent years, too. According to the Federal Foreign Office, the regional focus of German efforts was on East and West Africa, the western Balkans and Ukraine. Other projects supported were in Latin America and the Caribbean. It is possible that projects with a duration longer than one year are counted more than once.<br><br><br><br>The reported projects are not financed exclusively by the Federal Foreign Office, but in part with third-party funds as well. Thus, the indicator also takes into account those projects that are financed only in part by the government. The number of projects undertaken, however, says nothing about their scope or success. In addition, it is important to have well-defined and communicated criteria to clearly match a project with the objective of the indicator. The annual disarmament reports list projects aimed at combating small arms and their financing. Their number differs from the figures reported for the indicator. One reason for this could be the focus of the projects, which is decisive for the respective classification. The indicator also takes into account aspects other than the extent of government participation in these projects.<br><br><br><br>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) also publishes detailed figures on \u201cReintegration; Combating small arms and light weapons\u201d projects (funding code 15240) in accordance with the Statistical Reporting Directives of the Development Assistance Committee. Again, there is a degree of uncertainty as parts of a project could be aimed at combating small arms and light weapons but are not accounted for because of the focus of the overall project.<br><br><br><br>If the indicator were to be based on the number of projects in accordance with the OECD funding code, the target of at least 15 projects per year would have been met only in 2006 and 2016. Between these years, the values would have been below the target value. However, these projects also include measures, for instance to reintegrate demobilised military personnel into the economy. Without these measures of reintegration, the number of projects that focus exclusively or predominantly on combating small arms and light weapons would have been smaller.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Federal Foreign Office","source_organisation_1_short":"Federal Foreign Office","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/aa.png\" alt=\" Federal Foreign Office\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","history_active_1":true,"history_indicator_1":"16.2 Number of projects to secure, register and destroy small arms and light weapons carried out by Germany in affected regions of the world","history_target_1":"By 2030 at least 15 projects each year","history_year_a_1":"2019","history_status_year_a_1":"Sonne","history_year_b_1":"2018","history_status_year_b_1":"Sonne","history_year_c_1":"2017","history_status_year_c_1":"Sonne","history_year_d_1":"2016","history_status_year_d_1":"Sonne","history_year_e_1":"2015","history_status_year_e_1":"Sonne","history_year_f_1":"2014","history_status_year_f_1":"Sonne","history_year_g_1":"2013","history_status_year_g_1":"Wolke","data_show_map":null,"data_keywords":null,"data_start_values":[{"field":"Display","value":"Time series"},{"field":"Display","value":"Target"}],"data_footnote":null,"computation_units":"Index respectively Number","copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2021","graph_title":"Number of projects to secure, register and destroy small arms and light weapons carried out by Germany in affected regions of the world","graph_type":"bar","graph_min_value":null,"graph_max_value":null,"span_gaps":true,"show_line":true,"stackedBar":null,"national_geographical_coverage":null,"page_content":"<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h3>\n      <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/en/status/\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Sonne.png\" title=\"If the trend continues, the target value will be met or the difference between the target value and the current value will be less than 5&nbsp;%\" alt=\"Weathersymbol\" />\n      </a>\n    </h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"my-header-note\">\n    <span> (Evaluation of the year 2019 as reporting year from indicator report 2021)</span>\n  </div>\n</div>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-03-25","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-25","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-03-25: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/DnsTestEnvironment/dns-data/commit/02c3bed61396013399007d015a93d8e3fffb58c0","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-03-25: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/DnsTestEnvironment/dns-data/commit/f72ad64f6280dee307fa9b8113abb3e2fc724bc4","language":"en","postulate":"Taking practical action to combat proliferation, especially of small arms"}
