Depending on the particular survey, different understandings of corruption may serve as a basis and the sources for the calculation may change over time. The index includes countries for which at least three selected surveys are available. As such, the CPI is the most comprehensive overview study on perceived public sector corruption.<br><br><br><br>In its analysis of the CPI, the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission points out that, the statistical significance of the change must also be examined when the results are interpreted and that even in the case of statistically significant differences, the results of this indicator should be interpreted with caution.<br><br><br><br>Compared to 2012, Germany\u2019 score improved from 79 to 81 points in 2017. This figure has not changed since 2015, which means that Germany has moved down to twelfth place in the ranking. Though, compared with 2012, this change should not be viewed as statistically significant (at a significance level of 5&nbsp;%).<br><br><br><br>The Federal Statistical Office also gathers information on the topic of corruption as part of its satisfaction survey on official services. According to this survey, during their contact with public authorities 3.7&nbsp;% of the population had the impression in 2017 that public service employees were susceptible to corruption. In the corresponding survey of companies, 2.4&nbsp;% of companies had the impression that public service employees were open to corruption.<br><br><br><br>The Police Crime Statistics (PKS) record all criminal matters that become known to the police. In 2017, 961 cases of accepting/granting a benefit as well as taking/offering a bribe were recorded in the public sector. Furthermore, the PKS also list cases where bribes were taken or offered in commercial practice as well as concomitant offences of corruption such as fraud and breach of trust, document forgery, agreements in restriction of competition upon invitations to tender, obstruction of punishment, false certification in public office and violation of official secrecy.<br><br><br><br>With reference to German development assistance, 42 of the 85 partner countries evaluated by the CPI scored better in 2017 compared with 2012. In the review period, the number of partner countries developing in a positive direction has increased each year up to 2015. Their number stagnated in 2016 and declined slightly in 2017. As many as 21 partner countries of German development assistance reported a statistically significant improvement (at a significance level of 5&nbsp;%) in 2017 compared with 2012.
