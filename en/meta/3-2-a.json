The aim for 2030 is therefore to reduce the volume of air pollutants by 45% of their 2005 level. To make it possible to portray the development of pressure on both health and the ecosystem, German emissions of SO\u2082, NO\u2093, NH\u2083, NMVOCs and PM\u2082.\u2085 have been combined into a single indicator.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of 30.11.2022. The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/publications/reports/en/2022.pdf\">indicator report 2022</a>.","indicator_name":"Emissions of air pollutants","section":"Air pollution","postulate":"Keeping the environment healthy","target_id":"3.2.1","previous":"3-1-f","next":"3-2-b","content_and_progress":"<i><a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/publications/reports/en/2022.pdf\">Text from the Indicator Report 2022 </a></i><br>Germany has made a commitment to the European Union to reduce emissions of air pollutants by 2030 as follows: Sulphur dioxide by 58%, nitrogen oxides by 65%, ammonia by 29%, volatile organic compounds by 28% and particulate matter by 43%. On this basis, the Federal Environment Agency calculated a non-weighted, arithmetic mean of the individual reductions in the specified air pollutants as a target. The rates of change in the individual air pollutants are offset equally against one another. Notwithstanding the separate reduction targets, this means that increasing emissions of individual pollutants covered by this indicator may be offset by higher reductions in the emissions of other pollutants.<br>The data are computed annually by the Federal Environment Agency from various sources. They serve as a basis for the reporting obligation under the Geneva Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) and the National Emission Ceilings (NEC) Directive. The data undergo further analysis as part of the environmental economic accounting performed by the Federal Statistical Office. The emissions, for instance, are broken down by origin into various branches of economic activity and private households.<br>Overall emissions of air pollutants fell by 24.7% from 2005 to 2018. The indicator has thus moved in the desired direction, and the target for 2030 will be achieved if the trend is maintained. Emissions of individual pollutants changed to varying degrees, however, in the period from 2005 to 2018.<br>Emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC)s, which are primarily due to the industrial use of solvents, were reduced by a significant 24.6% during that period. This means that the targeted reduction of 28% by 2030 is achievable.<br>Emissions of particulate matter (PM\u2082.\u2085) fell by 31.5% in the aforesaid period. If the annual average trend were maintained, the set reduction target would be achieved for these emissions too. The largest source of particulate emissions in 2018 was industry, which accounted for 29.3% of the total. Households and small-scale consumers discharged 24.1%, chiefly from heating systems. Transport accounted for 25.5% of particulate emissions, which was 10.6 percentage points down on 2005.<br>Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO\u2093x) fell by 27.0% from 2005 to 2018 and so are heading in the desired direction. The average reduction of the past few years, however, would not suffice to meet the target. The majority of nitrogen oxides emitted in 2018 came from transport and the energy industry.<br>Emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO\u2082), which are mainly discharged by the energy industry, fell by 39.5% in the reference period. This trend has moved in the right direction. The average reduction of the past few years would be sufficient to meet the target.<br>Emissions of ammonia (NH\u2083) declined by 0.8% from 2005 to 2018 and remain persistently high. This stagnation is mainly due to the spreading of fermentation residues from fuel crops. According to calculations by the Federal Environment Agency, 95.3% of all national ammonia emissions in 2018 originated from agricultural production, particularly livestock farming.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\">German Environment Agency</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\">German Environment Agency</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\"><img src=\"https://dnsUpgradeEnvironment.github.io/dns-indicators/en/public/OrgImgDe/uba.png\" alt=\"German Environment Agency\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationGerman Environment Agency\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_1":"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en/image/index-of-air-pollutant-emissions","source_url_text_1":"Index of air pollutant emissions","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"3.2.a Emissions of air pollutants","weather_indicator_1_year_a":"2020","weather_indicator_1_year_b":"2019","weather_indicator_1_year_c":"2018","weather_indicator_1_year_d":"2017","weather_indicator_1_year_e":"2016","weather_indicator_1_year_f":"2015","weather_indicator_1_year_g":"2014","weather_indicator_1_target":"Reduction of emissions to 55% of 2005 level (unweighted average of the five pollutants) by 2030","weather_indicator_1_item_a":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_item_a_title":"If the trend continues, the target value would be reached or missed by less than 5% of the difference between the target value and the current value.","weather_indicator_1_item_b":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_item_b_title":"If the trend from 2019 had continued, the target value would have been reached or missed by less than 5% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_item_c":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_item_c_title":"If the trend from 2018 had continued, the target value would have been reached or missed by less than 5% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_item_d":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_item_d_title":"If the trend from 2017 had continued, the target value would have been reached or missed by less than 5% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_item_e":"Leicht bew\u00f6lkt","weather_indicator_1_item_e_title":"If the development from 2016 had continued, the target had been missed by at least 5%, but by a maximum of 20% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_item_f":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_item_f_title":"If the trend from 2015 had continued, the target value would have been reached or missed by less than 5% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_item_g":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_item_g_title":"Although the indicator has in 2014 been moving in the desired direction toward the target, if the trend had to continued, the target would have been missed in the target year by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","data_show_map":false,"copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2022","data_footnote":"Sulphur dioxide (SO\u2082), nitrogen oxides (NO\u2093), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and particulate matter (PM\u2082.\u2085), average index of measured values.","graph_title":"Emissions of air pollutants","graph_annotations":[{"value":55.0,"label":{"content":"Target 2030","position":"left"},"preset":"target_line"}],"precision":[{"decimals":1.0}],"span_gaps":true,"show_line":true,"graph_type":"bar","data_start_values":[{"field":"Time series","value":"Emissions of air pollutants"}],"graph_stepsize":[{"step":10.0}],"national_geographical_coverage":"Germany","page_content":"\n\n<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h5>Air pollutants: Reduction to 55% by 2030\n      <a href=\"https://dnsUpgradeEnvironment.github.io/dns-indicators/en/status\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Sonne.png\" title=\"If the trend from 2020 had continued, the target value would have been reached or missed by less than 5% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.\" alt=\"Weathersymbol: Sun\"/>\n      </a>\n    </h5>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"my-header-note\">\n  </div>\n</div>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-10-27","national_data_updated_date":"2022-10-24","indicator_number":"3.2.a","target_number":"3.2","goal_number":"3","language":"en"}
