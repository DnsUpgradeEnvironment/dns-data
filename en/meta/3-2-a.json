On this basis, the German Environment Agency calculated an unweighted arithmetic mean of the individual reductions of the above air pollutants as a joint target value. The individual rates of change of the single air pollutants are offset equally against one another. This means that irrespective of the separate reduction targets under the NEC Directive, increasing emissions of individual pollutants can be compensated for in this indicator by reducing the emissions of other pollutants.<br><br><br><br>The data are computed annually by the German Environment Agency using various sources. They serve as a basis for the reporting obligation pursuant to the Geneva Convention (CLRTAP) and the NEC Directive. The data are further processed within the context of the Federal Statistical Office\u2019s Environmental-Economic Accounts. As a result, emissions are published according to various production sectors and households along with other emitters.<br><br><br><br>Emissions of air pollutants overall fell by 17.5&nbsp;% until 2016 from 2005. The indicator thus moved in the intended direction but will not reach the target for 2030 if the development remains the same. Emissions of individual pollutants changed to varying degrees in the period from 2005 to 2016.<br><br><br><br>Emissions of volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), which are primarily due to the industrial use of solvents, were significantly reduced by 20.5&nbsp;% during the specified period. Consequently, the targeted reduction of 28&nbsp;% can be achieved by 2030.<br><br><br><br>In the specified period emissions of particulate matter (PM<sub>2,5</sub>) have been reduced by 25.3&nbsp;%. If this annual trend continues, the set reduction target will be reached. At 26.4&nbsp;%, the largest proportion of PM<sub>2,5</sub> emissions originated from households and small consumers and was caused in particular by heat generation in 2016. The transport sector accounted for 24.8&nbsp;% of PM<sub>2,5</sub> emissions in the same year.<br><br><br><br>Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) were reduced by 22.9&nbsp;% until 2016, hence going in the intended direction. However, the average reduction of the last few years will not be sufficient to achieve the target. In 2016 the main share of nitrogen oxides was emitted mainly by transport and the energy sector.<br><br><br><br>Emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), which are mainly generated in the energy sector, decreased by 24.8&nbsp;% in the specified period. Although these emissions went down as intended, the average reduction achieved in recent years will not be sufficient to achieve the set goal.<br><br><br><br>Following a prolonged period of stagnation, emissions of ammonia increased by a total of 6.0&nbsp;% between 2005 and 2016, and therefore contrary to the intended direction. The increase can be attributed primarily to the distribution of residues from the fermentation of fuel crops. According to calculations by the German Environment Agency, 95.0&nbsp;% of all domestic ammonia emissions in 2016 originated from agricultural production, and from livestock farming in particular.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"German Environment Agency","source_organisation_1_short":"German Environment Agency (UBA)","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/uba.png\" alt=\" German Environment Agency (UBA)\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_1":"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/bild/index-der-luftschadstoff-emissionen","source_url_text_1":null,"history_active_1":true,"history_indicator_1":"3.2.a Emissions of air pollutants","history_target_1":"Reduce emissions to 55&nbsp;% of the 2005 value by 2030","history_year_a_1":"2018","history_status_year_a_1":"Sonne","history_year_b_1":"2017","history_status_year_b_1":"Sonne","history_year_c_1":"2016","history_status_year_c_1":"Sonne","history_year_d_1":"2015","history_status_year_d_1":"Leicht bew\u00f6lkt","history_year_e_1":"2014","history_status_year_e_1":"Wolke","history_year_f_1":"2013","history_status_year_f_1":"Leicht bew\u00f6lkt","history_year_g_1":"2012","history_status_year_g_1":"Sonne","data_show_map":null,"data_keywords":null,"data_start_values":[{"field":"Display","value":"Time series"},{"field":"Display","value":"Target"},{"field":"Air pollutants","value":"Air pollutants overall"},{"field":"Air pollutants","value":"SO<sub>2</sub>"},{"field":"Air pollutants","value":"NO<sub>x</sub>"},{"field":"Air pollutants","value":"NH<sub>3</sub>"},{"field":"Air pollutants","value":"NMVOC"},{"field":"Air pollutants","value":"PM<sub>2.5</sub>"}],"data_footnote":"Sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) and particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), average index of measurements","computation_units":"2005 = 100","copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2021","graph_title":"Emissions of air pollutants","graph_type":"bar","graph_min_value":null,"graph_max_value":null,"span_gaps":true,"show_line":true,"stackedBar":null,"national_geographical_coverage":"Germany","page_content":"<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h3>\n      <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/en/status/\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Sonne.png\" title=\"If the trend continues, the target value will be met or the difference between the target value and the current value will be less than 5&nbsp;%\" alt=\"Weathersymbol\" />\n      </a>\n    </h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"my-header-note\">\n    <span> (Evaluation of the year 2018 as reporting year from indicator report 2021)</span>\n  </div>\n</div>","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-03-25: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/DnsTestEnvironment/dns-data/commit/b4b3ae10cb9c9e9f1775068849e8e18341dd5d17","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-03-25: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/DnsTestEnvironment/dns-data/commit/f72ad64f6280dee307fa9b8113abb3e2fc724bc4","language":"en","postulate":"Keeping the environment healthy"}
