Both are complete surveys based on the administrative data of the institutions of higher education. The indicator includes the students in the winter semester of each year. However, the researchers are covered on the reference date of 1st of December. Researchers in this context are defined as academic personnel at German institutions of higher education in primary and secondary employment (excluding student assistants). Doctoral candidates who are enrolled as students at an institution of higher education and who are also working as member of the academic personnel may be counted twice by the indicator.<br><br><br><br>The total number of all students and researchers from developing and emerging countries at German institutions of higher education was 247,433 in 2017. With 92.9&nbsp;%, students by far accounted for the largest share of the indicator value.<br><br><br><br>In the winter semester of 2017/18, 229,881 students from developing and emerging countries were enrolled in German institutions of higher education. This corresponds to [8.1](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/8-1-a/)&nbsp;% of all enrollees. The number of students from developing and emerging countries has increased steadily since 2005 (126,672 students) \u2013 the only decline recorded was during the year of 2007. The increase in the winter semester of 2017/18 was around 7.0&nbsp;% compared to the previous year (214,813 students in the winter semester of 2016/17). In the winter semester of 2017/18, a total of 10,574 students came from LDCs, 4.5&nbsp;% more than in the previous year.<br><br><br><br>Of the 229,881 students from developing and emerging countries who were enrolled at German institutions of higher education in the winter semester of 2017/18, 39,338 came from Turkey, 39,541 from China and 17,570 of the students came from India. In total, 43.2&nbsp;% of these were female students. Whereas the European developing and emerging countries sent roughly equal numbers of women and men to study in Germany (53.5&nbsp;%), a third of the students from Oceania were women (33.3&nbsp;%). The proportion of women among students from LDCs was one quarter (25.5&nbsp;%).<br><br><br><br>In 2017, 17,552 researchers from developing and emerging countries were part of the academic personnel at German institutions of higher education. They accounted for 4.4&nbsp;% of all academic staff at German institutions of higher education. Compared to the previous year, their numbers increased by 10.6&nbsp;%, and more than doubled since 2005. A total of 649 researchers came from LDCs in 2017 (0.2&nbsp;% of all academic personnel). This compares with a figure of 558 researchers in the previous year. This was an increase of 16.3&nbsp;%.<br><br><br><br>Overall, the number of students and researchers from developing and emerging countries has been continuously increasing since 2007.
