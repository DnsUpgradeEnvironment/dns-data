If several different collective agreements apply to an employment relationship, the employment relationship is recorded only once. Furthermore, the indicator cannot be directly transferred to the proportion of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, as individuals may hold multiple employment relationships. The indicator refers exclusively to the quantitative prevalence of collective bargaining agreements, which can vary considerably in content. Collective bargaining agreements that cover comprehensive working conditions&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;such as remuneration, working hours, vacation duration, and special payments&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;are included in the indicator, as are collective bargaining agreements that may be limited to only one of these areas and thus exert a correspondingly smaller influence on employment relationships.<br><br>The data on the proportion of employment relationships covered by collective bargaining agreements come from the annual IAB Establishment Panel on the Prevalence of Collective Bargaining Agreements and Employee Participation in Workplaces in Germany, which is collected by the Institute for Employment Research (IAB). The IAB surveyed 15,000&nbsp;companies nationwide from all sectors and sizes. The surveyed companies represent a representative sample of the approximately 2.1&nbsp;million companies in Germany with at least one employee subject to social insurance contributions.<br><br>In Germany, a distinction is made between industry-wide collective agreements (also known as area-wide collective agreements) and company-wide collective agreements (also known as in-house collective agreements). Industry-wide collective agreements are generally concluded between an employers\" association and a trade union for a specific economic sector and apply to the members of the contracting associations. Company-wide collective agreements, on the other hand, are generally concluded directly with individual employers.<br><br>German collective bargaining law provides that the legal provisions of a collective agreement can extend beyond the parties actually bound by the collective agreement to previously non-union employers and employees through so-called declarations of general applicability. With the declaration of general applicability, the working conditions stipulated in the collective agreement, such as wages, working hours, and other regulations, apply to all employers and their employees within the scope of the collective agreement.<br><br>In 2023, the share of employment relationships covered by collective bargaining fell below the 50&nbsp;percent mark for the first time at 49.5%. If only private-sector companies are considered, collective bargaining coverage is lower than if the public sector is included. In the private sector, 35% of employment relationships are subject to a sectoral collective agreement and 7% to a company-level collective agreement.<br><br>The majority of all employment relationships (41.6%) are subject to sectoral collective agreements in 2023, and only about 7.9% to company-level collective agreements. The general downward trend in collective bargaining coverage has existed since the mid-1990s and results almost exclusively from the declining number of sectoral collective agreements. In contrast, the share of employment relationships covered by company-level collective agreements has remained virtually constant since 1998.<br><br>The collective bargaining coverage of companies depends heavily on their number of employees: In small companies with one to four employees, collective bargaining coverage is only 15%, while it increases with company size. In companies with 5&nbsp;to 9&nbsp;employees, it is 21%, in companies with 10&nbsp;to 20&nbsp;employees, 33%, and in companies with 101&nbsp;to 200&nbsp;employees, 48%. Smaller companies are significantly more numerous than large companiesin Germany. This, combined with the lower level of collective bargaining coverage in smaller companies, means that the proportion of collective bargaining coverage is even lower when companies are considered instead of employees: in 2023, only 22% of companies were covered by a sectoral collective agreement and only 2% by a company-level collective agreement.<br><br><br><br>There is a significant regional difference between the former West Germany and the new federal states. In the new federal states, 45% of employment relationships are covered by a collective agreement, while this proportion is 51% in the former West Germany. However, the general decline in collective bargaining coverage can be observed in both the former West Germany and the new federal states.</p>","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://iab.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Institut for Employment Research', 'En')\">Institut for Employment Research</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://iab.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Institut for Employment Research', 'En')\">Institut for Employment Research</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://iab.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Institut for Employment Research', 'En')\"><img src=\"https://dnsTestEnvironment.github.io/site/public/OrgImgEn/iab.png\" alt=\"Institut for Employment Research\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationInstitut for Employment Research\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border:transparent\"/></a>","source_url_1":"https://iab.de/daten/daten-zur-tarifbindung-und-betrieblichen-interessenvertetung/","source_url_text_1":"Daten zur Tarifbindung und betrieblichen Interessenvertretung","source_url_alert_1":"the Institut for Employment Research","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"8.5.c Tarifgebundene Besch\u00e4ftigungsverh\u00e4ltnisse","weather_indicator_1_year_a":2023,"weather_indicator_1_year_b":2022,"weather_indicator_1_year_c":2021,"weather_indicator_1_year_d":2020,"weather_indicator_1_year_e":2019,"weather_indicator_1_year_f":2018,"weather_indicator_1_year_g":2017,"weather_indicator_1_target":"Anteil der tarifgebundenen Besch\u00e4ftigungsverh\u00e4ltnisse bis 2030&nbsp;erh\u00f6hen","weather_indicator_1_target_1":"Anteil der tarifgebundenen Besch\u00e4ftigungsverh\u00e4ltnisse bis 2030&nbsp;erh\u00f6hen","weather_indicator_1_target_1_category":"normal","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a":"Blitz","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_title":"In 2023 neither the average value nor the last change pointed in the right direction.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b":"Blitz","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_title":"In 2022 neither the average value nor the last change pointed in the right direction.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_title":"In 2021 the average value aimed in the wrong direction or indicates stagnation, but the previous year had shown a turn in the desired direction.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d":"Blitz","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d_title":"In 2020 neither the average value nor the last change pointed in the right direction.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_e":"Blitz","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_e_title":"In 2019 neither the average value nor the last change pointed in the right direction.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_e_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_f":"Blitz","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_f_title":"In 2018 neither the average value nor the last change pointed in the right direction.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_f_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_g":"Blitz","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_g_title":"In 2017 neither the average value nor the last change pointed in the right direction.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_g_valid":true,"data_show_map":false,"copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2025","precision":[{"decimals":1.0}],"span_gaps":true,"show_line":true,"graph_type":"line","data_start_values":[{"field":"Time series","value":"XXXTarifgebundene Besch\u00e4ftigungsverh\u00e4ltnisse"}],"graph_limits":[{"minimum":0.0,"maximum":100.0}],"graph_stepsize":[{"step":10.0}],"national_geographical_coverage":"Germany","rating":"<a href=\"https://dnsUpgradeEnvironment.github.io/site/status\"><img src=\"https://sdg-indikatoren.de/public/Wettersymbole/Blitz.png\" title=\"Weder Durchschnittswert noch die vorherige Ver\u00e4nderung deuten in 2023 in die richtige Richtung.\" alt=\"Wettersymbol Blitz\"/></a>","target_description":"Der Anteil der tarifgebundenen Besch\u00e4ftigungsverh\u00e4ltnisse soll steigen.<br><br>Ausgehend von der Zielformulierung deuten sowohl der aktuelle Wert, als auch die durchschnittliche Ver\u00e4nderung der letzten sechs Jahre in Richtung einer Verringerung.
