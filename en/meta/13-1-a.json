The Federal Government therefore aims to lower greenhouse gas emissions in Germany by at least 40&nbsp;% compared with 1990 by 2020. Additional targets are the reduction by at least 55&nbsp;% by 2030, by at least 70&nbsp;% by 2040 and by 80 to 95&nbsp;% by 2050 \u2013 in each case compared with 1990.","data_state":"Der Indikatorenbericht 2021 hat den Datenstand 31.12.2020.

Because of cumulation, however, the development of the individual greenhouse gases cannot be determined. A negative development of one greenhouse gas can for instance be concealed by a positive development of another greenhouse gas.<br><br><br><br>The data are provided annually by the German Environment Agency as part of the reporting under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. The determination and reporting of emissions is subject to a comprehensive quality management system.<br><br><br><br>The calculation is made according to the polluter pays and territorial concept. This means that the most important sources of emissions in Germany are identified for all greenhouse gases and air pollutants. For these sources the level of emissions under certain conditions was determined. As a result, a specific emissions factor is obtained, which is then multiplied by the activity data of a source to quantify the amount of emissions.<br><br><br><br>Note that the indicator according to the Kyoto Protocol does not show the carbon dioxide emissions arising from land use, land use change and forestry. Sea transport and international air transport are also excluded from the calculation.<br><br><br><br>A closer look at the development over the last five years shows that the indicator has not developed in a stable manner. In 2013, the emission values of greenhouse gases increased by 1.4&nbsp;%, while they decreased considerably by 3.1&nbsp;% in 2014. In 2015 and 2016, they again increased slightly by 0.3&nbsp;% and 0.2&nbsp;%, respectively. In the long run, as was shown by the near real time forecast of the German Environment Agency in 2017, a decline of a total of 27.7&nbsp;% compared with 1990 can be observed. If the development recorded over the last five years continues, it is unlikely that the target set for 2020 \u2013 a 40% reduction compared with 1990 \u2013 can be achieved.<br><br><br><br>Carbon dioxide accounted for the by far largest proportion of total greenhouse gas emissions in 2017 (88.1&nbsp;%), compared with 84.1&nbsp;% in 1990. Methane contributed 6.0&nbsp;%, laughing gas 4.2&nbsp;%, hydroflourocarbons 1.2&nbsp;% and sulphur hexaflouride 0.4&nbsp;% to the greenhouse gas emissions (last two figures for 2016). By far the largest part of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is created by the generation of electricity and heat. Methane and laughing gas are emitted primarily by agricultural production.<br><br><br><br>The indicator has cross references, for instance, to indicators 3.2 \u201cAir pollution\u201d, 7.2 \u201cRenewable energies\u201d and 11.2 \u201cMobility\u201d.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"German Environment Agency","source_organisation_1_short":"German Environment Agency (UBA)","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/uba.png\" alt=\" German Environment Agency (UBA)\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_1":"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/indikator-emission-von-treibhausgasen","source_url_text_1":null,"source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"AK UGRdL","source_organisation_2_short":"AK UGRdL","source_organisation_logo_2":"<a href=\"http://www.statistikportal.de/de/ugrdl/der-ak-ugrdl\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/akugrdl.png\" alt=\" AK UGRdL\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_2":"http://www.statistikportal.de/de/ugrdl/ergebnisse/gase","source_url_text_2":null,"history_active_1":true,"history_indicator_1":"13.1.a Greenhouse gas emissions","history_target_1":"Reduce by at least 40&nbsp;% by 2020, by at least 55&nbsp;% by 2030, by at least 70&nbsp;% by 2040 and by 80 to 95&nbsp;% by 2050 \u2013 in each case compared with 1990","history_year_a_1":"2019","history_status_year_a_1":"Wolke","history_year_b_1":"2018","history_status_year_b_1":"Wolke","history_year_c_1":"2017","history_status_year_c_1":"Wolke","history_year_d_1":"2016","history_status_year_d_1":"Wolke","history_year_e_1":"2015","history_status_year_e_1":"Wolke","history_year_f_1":"2014","history_status_year_f_1":"Wolke","history_year_g_1":"2013","history_status_year_g_1":"Wolke","data_show_map":true,"data_keywords":null,"data_start_values":[{"field":"Display","value":"Time series"},{"field":"Display","value":"Target"},{"field":"Region","value":"Germany"}],"data_footnote":"Greenhouse gases (Germany) = carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), laughing gas (N<sub>2</sub>O), sulphur hexaflouride (SF<sub>6</sub>), nitrogen triflouride (NF<sub>3</sub>), hydroflourocarbons (HFC) and perflourocarbons (PFC);  Greenhouse gases (Federal states) = carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), laughing gas (N<sub>2</sub>O); 2019 provisional near real time forecast","computation_units":"1990 = 100","copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2021","graph_title":"Greenhouse gas emissions in CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents","graph_type":"line","graph_min_value":null,"graph_max_value":null,"span_gaps":true,"show_line":true,"stackedBar":null,"national_geographical_coverage":"Germany","page_content":"<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h3>\n      <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/en/status/\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Wolke.png\" title=\"The indicator is moving in the right direction but if the trend continues, the target value will be missed by more than 20&nbsp;% in the target year\" alt=\"Weathersymbol\" />\n      </a>\n    </h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"my-header-note\">\n    <span> (Evaluation of the development of Germany in the reporting year 2019 - from indicator report 2021)</span>\n  </div>\n</div>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-07-08","national_data_updated_date":"2022-07-08","indicator_number":"13.1.a","target_number":"13.1","goal_number":"13","language":"en","postulate":"Reducing greenhouse gases"}
