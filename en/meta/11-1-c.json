With regard to population data, the 2011 census caused a jump in the time series, which is why only the comparisons up to 2010 and from 2011 onwards can be usefully interpreted. <br><br><br><br>Regarding the area survey by type of actual use, a methodological change in the survey basis took place in 2016, so that the comparability of the data with previous years is limited from 2016 onwards. In order to be able to compare the data, the respective values were recalculated on the basis of the 2011 Census and the change in the area survey in 2016.<br><br><br><br>The distinction between \u201crural\u201d and \u201cnon-rural\u201d is based on a type classification of the Th\u00fcnen Institute. This classification allocates a degree of \u201cruralness\u201d to rural districts and towns not attached to an administrative district \u2013 based on spatial characteristics such as \u201cdensity of settlements\u201d, \u201cshare of agricultural and forestry area\u201d and \u201clocation relative to the centres\u201d.<br><br><br><br>In contrast to population density, the concept of the density of settlements refers to the ratio of inhabitants solely to the settlement and transport area. In addition to residential building areas, the settlement area includes areas with special functional character (e.g. hospitals and schools), industrial and commercial areas and mixed-use areas as well as open areas (parks, green spaces, garden land). Consequently, changes not only in population numbers, but also in the residential building area, such as an internal densification of the transport or commercial area, lead to a change in the density of settlements.<br><br><br><br>The density of settlements differs substantially between rural and non-rural regions: one square kilometre of settlement and transport area accommodates around 3,330 people on average in non-rural district types, compared with around 1,216 people in rural district types (as in 2016). In this context, the residential building area in cities is frequently a much more densely built-up area as well as has many more multiple-floor buildings than rural regions, where more scattered development incorporating larger, unsealed areas such as domestic gardens is prevalent.<br><br><br><br>From 2000 until the end of 2010, there was a steady decline in the density of settlements in both rural and non-rural regions. In this context, the non-rural regions experienced a slightly lower absolute decrease than the rural regions. Viewed in relative terms, the 11&nbsp;% decline in rural regions, due to their considerably lower density of settlements, was however substantially larger than that of 4&nbsp;% in non-rural regions.<br><br><br><br>Since 2012, differences have been observed between the development in rural and non-rural regions. In non-rural regions, the density of settlements rose steadily from 3,251 inhabitants per square kilometre (2012) to 3,330 (2016). In rural regions, the decrease in the density of settlements continued at a moderate pace until 2014 (1,210 inhabitants/km\u00b2). In 2015, however, there was an increase (1,218 inhabitants/km\u00b2), presumably due to the population growth resulting from the influx of refugees, which slowed in 2016 (1,216 inhabitants/km\u00b2).<br><br><br><br>Considering the development of the number of inhabitants and the settlement and transport area separately, considerable differences between rural and non-rural regions can be observed. Between 2000 and 2015, the volume of the settlement and transport area in both rural and non-rural regions increased, although to different extents of 13&nbsp;% and 8&nbsp;% respectively. Following the slight increase in the population of rural regions at the start of the millennium, it decreased by around 2.3&nbsp;% until 2010 and then increased again slightly by 1&nbsp;% until 2016. In the non-rural regions, however, the population grew between 2000 and 2010 (by about 1.7&nbsp;%) and between 2011 and 2016 (by 4.4&nbsp;%). The effects of the development of additional settlement and transport area were therefore amplified in rural regions by the declining population numbers.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Federal Statistical Office (Destatis)","source_organisation_1_short":"Federal Statistical Office","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/destatis.png\" alt=\" Federal Statistical Office\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Federal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development (BBSR)","source_organisation_2_short":"Federal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development","source_organisation_logo_2":"<a href=\"https://www.bbsr.bund.de/BBSR/EN/home/_node.html\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/bbsr.png\" alt=\" Federal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","source_active_3":true,"source_organisation_3":"Th\u00fcnen-Institut","source_organisation_3_short":"Johann Heinrich von Th\u00fcnen-Institut","source_organisation_logo_3":"<a href=\"https://www.thuenen.de/en/\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/jht.png\" alt=\" Johann Heinrich von Th\u00fcnen-Institut\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","history_active_1":true,"history_indicator_1":"11.1.c Density of settlements","history_target_1":"No decrease in the density of settlements","history_year_a_1":"2018","history_status_year_a_1":"Leicht bew\u00f6lkt","history_year_b_1":"2017","history_status_year_b_1":"Leicht bew\u00f6lkt","history_year_c_1":"2016","history_status_year_c_1":"Leicht bew\u00f6lkt","history_year_d_1":"2015","history_status_year_d_1":"Wolke","history_year_e_1":"2014","history_status_year_e_1":"Blitz","history_year_f_1":"2013","history_status_year_f_1":"Blitz","history_year_g_1":"2012","history_status_year_g_1":"Blitz","data_show_map":true,"data_keywords":null,"data_start_values":[{"field":"Typification","value":"Rural and non-rural areas"},{"field":"Typification","value":"Non-rural areas"},{"field":"Typification","value":"Rural areas"}],"data_footnote":null,"computation_units":"2000 = 100","copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2021","graph_title":"Inhabitants per square kilometre of settlement and transport area","graph_type":"line","graph_min_value":75.0,"graph_max_value":105.0,"stackedBar":null,"national_geographical_coverage":"Germany","page_content":"<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h3>\n      <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/en/status/\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Leicht bew\u00f6lkt.png\" title=\"If the trend continues, the indicator will be presumably miss its target by at least 5&nbsp;% and at most 20&nbsp;% of the difference between the target value and the current value\" alt=\"Weathersymbol\" />\n      </a>\n    </h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"my-header-note\">\n    <span> (Evaluation of the development of Germany in the reporting year 2018 - from indicator report 2021)</span>\n  </div>\n</div>","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-03-25: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/DnsTestEnvironment/dns-data/commit/ca7427fe694b171b6bd2982b39db4bffaa04a759","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-03-25: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/DnsTestEnvironment/dns-data/commit/f72ad64f6280dee307fa9b8113abb3e2fc724bc4","language":"en"}
