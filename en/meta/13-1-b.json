The data source of the annually collected data is the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), which in this context also reports on climate financing by other federal ministries. In general, the information on bilateral climate finance is based on the relevant commitments, while the actual payments are taken as a basis for multilateral climate finance and contributions to energy and climate funds. The indicator also includes the proportionately attributed climate finance derived from contributions to multilateral funds at development banks. If climate finance mainly benefits developing countries, it is considered to be part of official development assistance (see indicator [17.1](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/17-1-a/)).<br><br><br><br>In 2017, Germany committed or provided 3.6 billion euros from budget funds for international climate finance to reduce greenhouse gases and adapt to climate change. Compared to the previous year, during which climate finance amounted to 3.4 billion euros, this represents an increase of [8.6](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/8-6-a/)&nbsp;%. A proportion of 43&nbsp;% of climate financing in 2017 was spent on emission reduction and 25&nbsp;% on adaptation to climate change. The remaining 32&nbsp;% were used to finance cross-sectoral projects. As in previous years, more funds were spent on mitigation than on adaptation projects in 2017.<br><br><br><br>Multilateral channels provided 13&nbsp;% (481 million euros) of climate finance in 2017. Of this amount, 187 million euros represent the climate finance allocated proporotionately to Germany, which results from contributions to multilateral funds at development banks.<br><br><br><br>The purely monetary analysis of climate finance does not allow any conclusions to be drawn regarding the impact of the financed projects. Based on its resources for technical and financial cooperation, the BMZ assesses how many tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions will be saved in the future through mitigation projects. The impact assessments of financial cooperation are based on ex-ante estimates of the financing commitments of a year, while those of technical cooperation are calculated on an ex-post basis.<br><br><br><br>In 2017, direct savings of 8.7 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents were achieved usingfinancial cooperation funds. Through technical cooperation funds, emissions of 9.1 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents were directly avoided between 2015 and 2017.<br><br><br><br>In addition to public climate financing from budget funds, the KfW (Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau) and the DEG (Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft) also provide climate-related loans via market funds. These represent the \u201cmobilised public climate finance\u201d which is not included in the indicator. In 2017, the resources mobilised in this way amounted to 3.1 billion euros compared to 5.2 billion euros in the previous year. Here again, more funds were disbursed for mitigation projects (83&nbsp;%) than for adaptation projects (9&nbsp;%).","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ)","source_organisation_1_short":"Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bmz.de/en/index.html\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/bmz.png\" alt=\" Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_1":"http://www.bmz.de/de/themen/klimaschutz/klimafinanzierung/index.html","source_url_text_1":null,"history_active_1":true,"history_indicator_1":"13.1.b International climate finance for the reduction of greenhouse gases and adaptation to climate change","history_target_1":"Double finance by 2020 relative to 2014","history_year_a_1":"2019","history_status_year_a_1":"Sonne","history_year_b_1":"2018","history_status_year_b_1":"Leicht bew\u00f6lkt","history_year_c_1":"2017","history_status_year_c_1":"Sonne","history_year_d_1":"2016","history_status_year_d_1":"Sonne","data_show_map":null,"data_keywords":null,"data_start_values":[{"field":"Display","value":"Time series"},{"field":"Display","value":"Target"}],"data_footnote":null,"computation_units":"Billions of euros","copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2021","graph_title":"Germany's climate finance flows primarily to developing and emerging countries","graph_type":"bar","graph_min_value":null,"graph_max_value":null,"span_gaps":true,"show_line":true,"stackedBar":null,"national_geographical_coverage":null,"page_content":"<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h3>\n      <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/en/status/\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Sonne.png\" title=\"If the trend continues, the target value will be met or the difference between the target value and the current value will be less than 5&nbsp;%\" alt=\"Weathersymbol\" />\n      </a>\n    </h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"my-header-note\">\n    <span> (Evaluation of the year 2019 as reporting year from indicator report 2021)</span>\n  </div>\n</div>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-03-25","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-25","indicator_number":"13.1.b","target_number":"13.1","goal_number":"13","language":"en","postulate":"Germany\u2019s contribution to international climate finance"}
