This corresponds to the management targets of the Ordinance on the Protection of Surface Waters amended in 2016 that were agreed during the implementation of the Water Framework Directive and to the objectives of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the Baltic Sea Action Plan.","data_state":"Der Indikatorenbericht 2021 hat den Datenstand 31.12.2020.

This also includes smaller rivers that flow into a larger river, rather than directly into the North Sea or the Baltic Sea. The measuring points are selected in such a way as to ensure that the data of the last measuring point before the confluence of the two rivers are taken into account. The Rhine, which does not flow into the sea in Germany, is also taken into account. Here the values are measured at the point where the Rhine leaves Germany (measuring point at Kleve, district Bimmen). The nitrogen concentrations of the individual rivers are averaged on a discharge-weighted basis, so that large rivers with large volumes of water discharge have a greater influence on the average than small rivers. Another substance that is discharged via rivers into the North Sea and the Baltic Sea and causes eutrophication is phosphorus. This is examined in detail in indicator 6.1.a \u201cPhosphorus in flowing waters\u201d.<br><br><br><br>To ensure that individual extreme events such as floods or droughts, which partly lead to very high or very low nitrogen inputs, do not distort the representativeness of the development, the values are calculated as a five-year moving average.<br><br><br><br>The discharge-weighted nitrogen concentration across all North Sea and Baltic Sea inflows showed a decreasing trend since the beginning of the time series, with the decrease in concentrations being more marked in the North Sea than in the Baltic Sea. On average in 2012 to2016, North Sea and Baltic Sea inflows reached concentrations of 2.9 and 3.0&nbsp;mg/l, respectively. However, to achieve a good status in accordance with the Surface Water Ordinance, it would be necessary for each individual river to meet the management target<br><br><br><br>Of the large Baltic Sea inflows, Peene, Trave and Warnow, only the Warnow (near Rostock) met the management target in the period 2012 to 2016. The value of the Peene (near Anklam) with 2.9&nbsp;mg/l and the value of the Trave (near L\u00fcbeck-Moisling) with 3.7&nbsp;mg/l were still higher. All three rivers showed a clear decrease in the five-year average concentrations. This decline was most marked for the Trave. Regarding the small Baltic Sea inflows, nitrogen concentrations are in part still considerably higher than the management target value (up to 6.0&nbsp;mg/l).<br><br><br><br>Of the North Sea inflows, only the Rhine met the management target in the period 2012 to 2016. Regarding the other major rivers, Elbe, Ems, Weser and Eider, the Ems (near Herbrum) had the highest concentration of 4.7&nbsp;mg/l and the Elbe (near Seemannsh\u00f6ft) and the Eider (near Friedrichstadt) the lowest concentrations (3.1&nbsp;mg/l each). The five-year averages of concentrations decreased for all major North Sea inflows. The river Elbe showed the largest reduction. The highest nitrogen concentration of the small North Sea inflows was 3.6&nbsp;mg/l in the years 2012 to 2016. Overall, permanent and nationwide compliance with the management targets is currently neither being met for the Baltic Sea nor for the North Sea.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"German Environment Agency using information from the L\u00e4nder and river basin communities","source_organisation_1_short":"German Environment Agency (UBA)","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/uba.png\" alt=\" German Environment Agency (UBA)\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" /></a>","source_url_1":"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/indikator-eutrophierung-von-nord-ostsee-durch","source_url_text_1":null,"source_url_1b":"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/daten/wasser/ostsee/flusseintraege-direkte-eintraege-in-die-ostsee","source_url_text_1b":"N\u00e4hrstoffeintr\u00e4ge \u00fcber Fl\u00fcsse und Direkteinleiter in die Ostsee","history_active_1":true,"history_indicator_1":"14.1.aa","history_target_1":"Maintain a good quality in accordance with the Ordinance on the Protection of Surface Waters (keep annual averages of total nitrogen below 2.6 milligrams per litre)","history_year_a_1":"2019","history_status_year_a_1":"Wolke","history_year_b_1":"2018","history_status_year_b_1":"Wolke","history_year_c_1":"2017","history_status_year_c_1":"Wolke","history_year_d_1":"2016","history_status_year_d_1":"Wolke","history_year_e_1":"2015","history_status_year_e_1":"Wolke","history_year_f_1":"2014","history_status_year_f_1":"Wolke","history_year_g_1":"2013","history_status_year_g_1":"Wolke","history_active_2":true,"history_indicator_2":"14.1.ab","history_target_2":"Maintain a good quality in accordance with the Ordinance on the Protection of Surface Waters (keep annual averages of total nitrogen below 2.8 milligrams per litre)","history_year_a_2":"2017","history_status_year_a_2":"Wolke","history_year_b_2":"2016","history_status_year_b_2":"Wolke","history_year_c_2":"2015","history_status_year_c_2":"Wolke","history_year_d_2":"2014","history_status_year_d_2":"Wolke","history_year_e_2":"2013","history_status_year_e_2":"Wolke","history_year_f_2":"2012","history_status_year_f_2":"Wolke","history_year_g_2":"2011","history_status_year_g_2":"Wolke","data_show_map":null,"data_keywords":null,"data_start_values":["a) time series","b) target (max)","north sea","Baltic sea"],"data_footnote":"Due to different data provision periods, data for the Baltic Sea inflows is available until 2018 and for the North Sea inflows until 2017.","computation_units":"Percent","copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2020","graph_title":"Total nitrogen concentration in the North and the Baltic Sea","graph_type":"line","graph_min_value":null,"graph_max_value":null,"stackedBar":null,"national_geographical_coverage":"Germany","page_content":"<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h3>aa) Baltic Sea\n      <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/en/status/\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Wolke.png\" title=\"The indicator is moving in the right direction but if the trend continues, the target value will be missed by more than 20&nbsp;% in the target year\" alt=\"Weathersymbol\" />\n      </a>\n    </h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"my-header-note\">\n    <span> (Evaluation of the year 2019 as reporting year from indicator report 2020)</span>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h3>ab) North Sea\n      <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/en/status/\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Wolke.png\" title=\"The indicator is moving in the right direction but if the trend continues, the target value will be missed by more than 20&nbsp;% in the target year\" alt=\"Weathersymbol\" />\n      </a>\n    </h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"my-header-note\">\n    <span> (Evaluation of the year 2017 as reporting year from indicator report 2020)</span>\n  </div>\n</div>","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-03-25: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/DnsTestEnvironment/dns-data/commit/f72ad64f6280dee307fa9b8113abb3e2fc724bc4","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-03-25: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/DnsTestEnvironment/dns-data/commit/f72ad64f6280dee307fa9b8113abb3e2fc724bc4","language":"en"}
