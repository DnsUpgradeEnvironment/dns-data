However, the computation of this indicator takes account only of those measuring stations that are not exposed to direct particulate matter emissions e.g. from transport, as these map only elevated peak values (\u201chot spots\u201d) rather than general pollution levels. This recorded data which is called background pollution is combined with geographical information to determine the number of persons who are exposed to an average annual particulate matter pollution of more than 20 \u03bcg per m\u00b3 of air at their place of residence. Since the modelled calculation is based only on measuring stations that are not exposed to direct particular matter emissions from local sources, it may well be assumed that the indicator underestimates the level of pollution.<br><br><br><br>Rather than indicating nationwide compliance with the guideline value, the indicator merely shows that the value is not exceeded at the population\u2019s places of residence. Neither does it give any indication of the exposure level of the population in total nor its variation in the course of the year. In addition, this indicator makes no provision for the separate analysis of pollution caused by finer particulate matter particles (PM<sub>2,5</sub> and PM<sub>0,1</sub>).<br><br><br><br>Particulate matter is mainly generated during the combustion processes of fossil fuels such as heating, in industrial plants or road traffic. Besides these primary sources, particulate matter can also be a secondary product of the chemical reaction of air pollutants, e.g. from agriculture.<br><br><br><br>The last few years have seen a significant reduction in particulate matter pollution caused by PM<sub>10</sub>. While in 2007 the average pollution exposure of the population was still 20.7 \u03bcg per m\u00b3 of air, in 2015 it was just 16.5 \u03bcg per m\u00b3. During the same period, the number of people exposed to an annual average of more than 20 \u03bcg PM<sub>10</sub> per m\u00b3 of air at their place of residence has also fallen considerably \u2013 from around 50 million people in 2007 to only around 4 million people in 2015. Part of the sharp decline between 2014 and 2015 is presumably due to the fact that there were exceptionally few periods of air stagnation in 2015.<br><br><br><br>If the average development of the past few years continues, it is likely that the achieved target of exposing the population nationwide to a background particulate matter pollution of less than 20 micrograms per cubic meter of air on an annual average can be sustained.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"German Environment Agency","source_organisation_1_short":"German Environment Agency (UBA)","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/uba.png\" alt=\" German Environment Agency (UBA)\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" /></a>","source_url_1":"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/indikator-belastung-der-bevoelkerung-durch-0","source_url_text_1":null,"source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"World Health Organization (WHO)","source_organisation_2_short":"World Health Organization","source_organisation_logo_2":"<a href=\"http://www.euro.who.int/en/home\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/who.png\" alt=\" World Health Organization\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" /></a>","history_active_1":true,"history_indicator_1":"3.2.b Share of the population with excessive exposure to PM<sub>10</sub> in Germany","history_target_1":"WHO particulate matter guideline value of 20 micrograms/ cubic metre for PM<sub>10</sub> to be adhered to as widely as possible by 2030","history_year_a_1":"2018","history_status_year_a_1":"Sonne","history_year_b_1":"2017","history_status_year_b_1":"Sonne","history_year_c_1":"2016","history_status_year_c_1":"Sonne","history_year_d_1":"2015","history_status_year_d_1":"Sonne","history_year_e_1":"2014","history_status_year_e_1":"Sonne","history_year_f_1":"2013","history_status_year_f_1":"Wolke","history_year_g_1":"2012","history_status_year_g_1":"Sonne","data_show_map":null,"data_keywords":null,"data_start_values":["Time series","Target"],"data_footnote":null,"computation_units":"Population, millions","copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2020","graph_title":"Particulate matter exposure (PM<sub>10</sub>) of at least 20 \u03bcg per m<sup>3</sup> of air on average per year","graph_type":"line","graph_min_value":null,"graph_max_value":null,"stackedBar":null,"national_geographical_coverage":"Germany","page_content":"<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h3>\n      <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/en/status/\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Sonne.png\" title=\"If the trend continues, the target value will be met or the difference between the target value and the current value will be less than 5&nbsp;%\" alt=\"Weathersymbol\" />\n      </a>\n    </h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"my-header-note\">\n    <span> (Evaluation of the year 2018 as reporting year from indicator report 2020)</span>\n  </div>\n</div>","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-03-25: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/DnsTestEnvironment/dns-data/commit/f72ad64f6280dee307fa9b8113abb3e2fc724bc4","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-03-25: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/DnsTestEnvironment/dns-data/commit/f72ad64f6280dee307fa9b8113abb3e2fc724bc4","language":"en"}
