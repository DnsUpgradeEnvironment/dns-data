The level of gross fixed capital formation includes additions (that is, acquisitions less disposals without taking into account consumption of fixed capital) of fixed assets by resident economic units. Fixed assets are produced assets that are designed for repeated or continuous use in production processes for longer than a year. These include buildings and structures (dwellings, other buildings and structures), equipment (machinery, vehicles, tools including weapons systems) and other assets (intellectual property such as investments in research and development, computer software and databases, entertainment, literary or artistic originals, mineral exploration and evaluation as well as animal resources and tree, crop and plant resources).

National accounts are compiled in accordance with harmonised international rules and standards, that is, the European System of Accounts (<abbr title=\"European System of Accounts\" tabindex=\"0\">ESVG</abbr>), and are based on all available, relevant data sources.<br><br>In 2021, the ratio of gross fixed capital formation to <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> was at 21.8&nbsp;% for the entire federal territory, price adjusted at 21.0&nbsp;%. The indicator has moved into the desired direction both in the short and medium term. Since 2015, the quota slightly increased (20.0&nbsp;%). The lack of a definition for appropriate development causes a positive appearance when considering the last six data points. In comparison, the investment ratio was 3.1&nbsp;percentage points below the initial value in 1991&nbsp;as well as 1.4&nbsp;percentage points lower than in 2000. After price adjustments, the share of gross fixed capital formation relative to <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> is 1.1&nbsp;percentage points below the value in 1991. Since 1996, the average investment ratio in Germany is lower than the investment ratio for the entire <abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\" tabindex=\"0\">OECD</abbr> region (2020: 22.2&nbsp;%). While the difference between 2001&nbsp;and 2010&nbsp;was \u20132.4&nbsp;percentage points on average, latter decreased in the period from 2011&nbsp;to 2020&nbsp;to \u20131.0. In the years from 2015&nbsp;to 2021, gross fixed capital formation soared by a total of 29.4&nbsp;%, reaching 783.8&nbsp;billion euros. Since the increase in nominal <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> was somewhat lower, at 19.0&nbsp;%, the investment ratio increased slightly from 20.0&nbsp;% to 21.8&nbsp;%. With regard to investments in building projects, housing construction has recorded strong nominal growth (+&nbsp;92.6&nbsp;%) since 2010, while the growth of investments in non-residential construction, including civil engineering, in the same period was less pronounced (52.7&nbsp;%) and even dipped slightly in 2012&nbsp;and 2015. Equipment investments increased by 28.0&nbsp;%. The strongest growth since 1991&nbsp;was recorded for investments in research and development as well as in computer software and databases. Its volume almost tripled.<br><br>The period from 1991&nbsp;to 2021&nbsp;witnessed a strong shift in investment activity from industry to the service sector. In 1991, 30.4&nbsp;% of new fixed capital formation was still being made by enterprises of the industry sector. By 2021, this figure had fallen to just 22.4&nbsp;%. In 2021, 76.3&nbsp;% of fixed capital formation was made in the service branches. In 1991, this figure was still 67.9&nbsp;%. The largest single investment area was that of real estate activities. In 2021&nbsp;alone, this sector accounted for 33.1&nbsp;% of all new fixed assets.
