The GDP at current prices is determined by the Federal Statistical Office as part of the national accounts system and published as a preliminary value in January of the following year.<br><br><br><br>The debt-to-GDP ratio is influenced by the state of the public budgets and by economic development in general. The indicator compares the \u201cdebt\u201d stock variable with the \u201cgross domestic product\u201d flow variable. According to the formula \u2013 assuming stable debt \u2013 the debt ratio falls faster the stronger GDP growth. In case of positive economic development, the debt-to- GDP ratio will even fall without any reduction in the overall public debt. <br><br><br><br>Furthermore, the indicator excludes implicit government debt, which refers to the government\u2019s future payment obligations that are pledged but not yet due.<br><br><br><br>Since 2003, the debt-to-GDP ratio in Germany has been continuously above the Europe-wide harmonised and compulsory threshold. Following public budget consolidation efforts in the middle of the last decade, it fell to 63.7&nbsp;% in 2007, only to increase further to a high of 81.0&nbsp;% by 2010. This increase has to be seen in the light of the financial market and economic crisis. Overall, the government debt increased by 420 billion euros from 1,669 billion euros in 2008 to 2,089 billion euros in 2010.<br><br><br><br>In the subsequent years, the burdens imposed by the financial market and economic crisis were considerably reduced. The debt ratio fell to 63.9&nbsp;% in 2017. Central government (Federation) reduced its debt for the first time in 2015 by 23.9 billion euros to 1,373 billion euros. In 2017 the debt of central government amounted to 1,351 billion euros. The debts of state government (L\u00e4nder) fell by 73.1 billion euros from their peak in 2012 to 611 billion euros in 2017. The debt owed by local government (municipalities) in Germany decreased slightly for the first time since 2007 to 148 billion euros (2017). Since 2010, the social security funds reduced their debt by 554 million euros to 792 million euros in 2017. In 2017, 64&nbsp;% of the overall debt was owed by central government (Federation), roughly 29&nbsp;% by state government (L\u00e4nder) and roughly 7&nbsp;% by local government (municipalities).<br><br><br><br>In the national balance of assets, the government debt is balanced by its assets \u2013 both tangible and financial. The biggest asset owned by the government is its buildings and structures (roads, schools, public buildings). According to the national wealth accounts compiled by the Federal Statistical Office, fixed assets were valued (after amortisation) at 1,359 billion euros in 2016. The financial assets were valued at 1,149 billion euros (2016). Among them, securities represent the most highly valued asset.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Federal Statistical Office (Destatis)","source_organisation_1_short":"Federal Statistical Office","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/destatis.png\" alt=\" Federal Statistical Office\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_1":"https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Wirtschaft/Volkswirtschaftliche-Gesamtrechnungen-Inlandsprodukt/Tabellen/eu-stabilitaetspakt-defizit-deutschland.html","source_url_text_1":null,"source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Deutsche Bundesbank","source_organisation_2_short":"German Bundesbank","source_organisation_logo_2":"<a href=\"https://www.bundesbank.de/en\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/bundesbank.png\" alt=\" German Bundesbank\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_2":"https://www.bundesbank.de/dynamic/action/de/statistiken/zeitreihen-datenbanken/zeitreihen-datenbank/759778/759778?listId=www_v27_web011_21a","source_url_text_2":null,"history_active_1":true,"history_indicator_1":"8.2.c Government debt","history_target_1":"Ratio of government debt to GDP must not exceed 60&nbsp;%, to be continued up to 2030","history_year_a_1":"2019","history_status_year_a_1":"Sonne","history_year_b_1":"2018","history_status_year_b_1":"Wolke","history_year_c_1":"2017","history_status_year_c_1":"Wolke","history_year_d_1":"2016","history_status_year_d_1":"Wolke","history_year_e_1":"2015","history_status_year_e_1":"Wolke","history_year_f_1":"2014","history_status_year_f_1":"Blitz","history_year_g_1":"2013","history_status_year_g_1":"Blitz","data_show_map":null,"data_keywords":null,"data_start_values":[{"field":"Display","value":"Target"},{"field":"Display","value":"Time series"}],"data_footnote":null,"computation_units":"Percentage share in gross domestic product at current prices","copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2021","graph_title":"Government debt","graph_type":"bar","graph_min_value":null,"graph_max_value":null,"span_gaps":true,"show_line":true,"stackedBar":null,"national_geographical_coverage":"Germany","page_content":"<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h3>\n      <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/en/status/\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Sonne.png\" title=\"If the trend continues, the target value will be met or the difference between the target value and the current value will be less than 5&nbsp;%\" alt=\"Weathersymbol\" />\n      </a>\n    </h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"my-header-note\">\n    <span> (Evaluation of the year 2019 as reporting year from indicator report 2021)</span>\n  </div>\n</div>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-07-08","national_data_updated_date":"2022-07-08","indicator_number":"8.2.c","target_number":"8.2","goal_number":"8","language":"en","postulate":"Consolidating public finances \u2013 Creating intergenerational equity"}
