To this end, all project and programme documents relating to food security projects are examined. The initial survey for 2016 was reviewed externally. That validation revealed that the data collection criteria and the definition of good governance needed to be specified in order to ensure comparability of the results. The methodology was subsequently revised.<br>A project is now counted if the objective, the effect matrix or the project description (a) specifically names a guideline or recommendation of the Global Strategic Framework for Food Security and Nutrition, or (b) a core element of the content of a guideline/recommendation is a substantial part of the project, and the project simultaneously aims to improve legal, institutional or political conditions. There must be congruity with the recording of the related spending as official development assistance (ODA).<br>In 2016, EUR 148 million of ODA for food security fell under the subheading of governance. On the basis of the revised methodology, this amount corresponds to 16.7% of the total expenditure of EUR 887 million. Both the total expenditure and the expenditure under the subheading of governance are thus considerably lower than the values calculated before the methodology was revised, which put governance expenditure for 2016 at 32% of a total of EUR 1,472 million. This is primarily due to a redefinition of the concept of governance and the use of an additional criterion in the form of the OECD governance indicator or, alternatively, of the governance criteria used in German development cooperation. <br>In 2018, a total of EUR 223 million, or 18.3% of the total expenditure of EUR 1,215 million on ODA for food security, fell under the subheading of governance. Compared with the total amount of official development assistance, however, the proportions allocated to both governance and food security are small. In 2018, for example, total spending on ODA amounted to EUR 25 billion. Of that amount, 4.9% went to food security and 0.9% to good governance within the realm of food security.<br>The indicator represents one facet of Germany\u2019s contribution to the achievement of SDG 2. In recent years the overall situation in the countries with which Germany engages in development cooperation initially showed a considerable improvement. According to figures from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the percentage of people suffering from undernourishment in these partner countries fell from 19% in the year 2000 to 14% in 2015. Current FAO estimates, however, indicate that the undernourishment rate has been rising worldwide since 2015 and that 280 million people were undernourished in 2018. That corresponds to 11% of the world\u2019s population.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bmz.de/en/index.html\">Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.bmz.de/en/index.html\">Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bmz.de/en/index.html\"><img src=\"ttps://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/bmz.png\" alt=\"Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"<a href=\"https://www.bmel.de/EN/Home/home_node.html\">Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture</a>","source_organisation_2_short":"<a href=\"https://www.bmel.de/EN/Home/home_node.html\">Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture</a>","source_organisation_logo_2":"<a href=\"https://www.bmel.de/EN/Home/home_node.html\"><img src=\"ttps://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/bmel.png\" alt=\"Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Ministry of Food and Agriculture\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"2.2 Support for good governance in attaining appropriate nutrition world-wide","weather_indicator_1_year_a":"-","weather_indicator_1_target":"Funds disbursed for the application of the guidelines and recommendations of the UN Committee on World Food Security (CFS) to be increased appropriately as a percentage of total spending on food security by 2030","weather_indicator_1_item_a":"Keine Bewertung m\u00f6glich","data_show_map":false,"copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2022","data_footnote":"Data based on a special evaluation.","graph_title":"Disbursement made primarily to developing and newly emerging countries to support good governance in the context of efforts to promote food security","graph_subtitle":"Percentage of total spending on food security devoted to good governance","precision":[{"decimals":1.0}],"span_gaps":true,"show_line":true,"graph_type":"bar","data_start_values":[{"field":"Time series","value":"Support for good governance in attaining appropriate nutrition world-wide"}],"graph_stepsize":[{"step":5.0}],"page_content":"\n\n<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h5>Angemessene Steigerung des Anteils bis 2030\n    </h5>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"my-header-note\">\n  </div>\n</div>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-09-09","national_data_updated_date":"2022-08-25","indicator_number":"2.2","target_number":"2.2","goal_number":"2","language":"en"}
