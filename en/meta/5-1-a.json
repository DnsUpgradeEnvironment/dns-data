Therefore, it only expresses the relative average gross hourly earnings as a ratio without considering the underlying causes, such as qualification, occupation or a different employment history.<br><br><br><br>The data for the indicator are based on the four-yearly structure of earnings survey conducted by the statistical offices of the L\u00e4nder as a representative sample survey covering a maximum of 60,000 businesses who are obliged to provide the requested information. Based on these data, results are provided by age, educational attainment, performance group, activity, collective agreement, company size class and economic sector, and the adjusted gender pay gap (GPG) is published. For the interim years, the unadjusted GPG is updated using the rates of change from the quarterly survey of earnings. In the following, the EU definition is used for the adjusted and unadjusted GPG; it excludes employees in \u201cagriculture, forestry and fishing\u201d, \u201cpublic administration and defence; compulsory social security\u201d and in micro-enterprises.<br><br><br><br>In 2017, the unadjusted gender pay gap was 21&nbsp;% on average. This means that the average gross hourly earnings of women were by around one fifth lower than those earnings of men. Since 1995 the unadjusted GPG has scarcely changed. Hence, if the trend recorded over the last five years continues, the goal set for 2020 will not be achieved.<br><br><br><br>On an EU average, the unadjusted GPG was 16&nbsp;% in 2016. The countries with the smallest differences in unadjusted gross hourly earnings, along with Italy and Romania (5&nbsp;%), were Belgium and Luxembourg (6&nbsp;%). Only in Estonia (25&nbsp;%) and the Czech Republic (22&nbsp;%) was the unadjusted GPG higher in 2016 than in Germany (21&nbsp;%).<br><br><br><br>However, there was no uniform picture for Germany. The unadjusted gender pay gap varied markedly between the L\u00e4nder: in 2017, the GPG was highest in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg with 27&nbsp;%, whereas in Saxony-Anhalt with its overall lower earnings level it was only 2&nbsp;%.<br><br><br><br>The factors underlying the GPG can be studied every four years based on the detailed results of the structure of earnings survey. The results for 2014 are currently available. These factors, which determine the differences in earnings, are subject to long-term change processes and therefore relatively stable over time. The main quantifiable reasons underlying the unadjusted GPG are women and men working in different sectors and occupations and the unequal division of job requirements in terms of leadership and qualification. In addition, women are more likely than men to be in part-time or marginal employment.<br><br><br><br>The above reasons explain, in statistical terms, around three quarters of the difference between hourly earnings at national level. The adjusted GPG of 6&nbsp;% in 2014 accounts for the remaining quarter of the difference in earnings.<br><br><br><br>Compared with the unadjusted GPG, the adjusted GPG presents a much more uniform picture at the level of the L\u00e4nder. In 2014, it was between 4&nbsp;% (in Thuringia) and 10&nbsp;% (in Brandenburg).","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Federal Statistical Office (Destatis)","source_organisation_1_short":"Federal Statistical Office","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/destatis.png\" alt=\" Federal Statistical Office\" title=\"Click here to visit the homepage of the organization\" style=\"border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_1":"https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Arbeit/Verdienste/Verdienste-Verdienstunterschiede/_inhalt.html","source_url_text_1":null,"history_active_1":true,"history_indicator_1":"5.1.a Gender pay gap","history_target_1":"Reduce the gap to 10&nbsp;% by 2020, maintain that proportion up to 2030","history_year_a_1":"2019","history_status_year_a_1":"Wolke","history_year_b_1":"2018","history_status_year_b_1":"Wolke","history_year_c_1":"2017","history_status_year_c_1":"Wolke","history_year_d_1":"2016","history_status_year_d_1":"Wolke","history_year_e_1":"2015","history_status_year_e_1":"Blitz","history_year_f_1":"2014","history_status_year_f_1":"Wolke","history_year_g_1":"2013","history_status_year_g_1":"Wolke","data_show_map":true,"data_keywords":null,"data_start_values":[{"field":"Display","value":"Time series"},{"field":"Display","value":"Target"},{"field":"Region","value":"Germany"}],"data_footnote":"2015 to 2019 provisional data; Federal States: Structure of earnings surveys updated with results of the quarterly earnings survey","computation_units":"Percentage of men's earnings","copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2021","graph_title":"Difference between average gross hourly earnings of women and men","graph_type":"line","graph_min_value":null,"graph_max_value":null,"stackedBar":null,"national_geographical_coverage":"Germany","page_content":"<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h3>\n      <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/en/status/\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Wolke.png\" title=\"The indicator is moving in the right direction but if the trend continues, the target value will be missed by more than 20&nbsp;% in the target year\" alt=\"Weathersymbol\" />\n      </a>\n    </h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"my-header-note\">\n    <span> (Evaluation of the development of Germany in the reporting year 2019 - from indicator report 2021)</span>\n  </div>\n</div>","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-03-25: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/DnsTestEnvironment/dns-data/commit/45961d32dd5a85c0698dffe02deaa3afb11c2b13","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-03-25: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/DnsTestEnvironment/dns-data/commit/f72ad64f6280dee307fa9b8113abb3e2fc724bc4","language":"en","postulate":"Promoting equal opportunities in society"}
