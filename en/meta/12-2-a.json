The goal is therefore to identify a total of 5,000 organisation premises for registration with EMAS by 2030.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2021 is as of 31.12.2020.

Having EMAS certification does not automatically mean that organisations or their products are more environmentally friendly than comparable organisations and products. EMAS involves a reporting obligation requiring organisations to submit environmental statements. These statements include reporting on the main environmental impacts of the organisation in question as well as data pertaining to energy and material efficiency, emissions, water, waste and use of land/biodiversity. Organisations have to update their environmental statements annually, with the exception introduced in 2010 that SMEs can apply to do so every two years instead. The environmental statement, which is public, and various additional internal documents are inspected by independent, licensed environmental verifiers. The verification must be repeated on a regular basis, no less than every three years. Organisations that pass the verification process and have no breaches of environmental regulations or complaints to answer for are added to the EMAS register. The German EMAS Advisory Board is responsible for quality assurance. EMAS organisations and locations are registered by the responsible chambers of industry and commerce and stored in a publicly accessible database at the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry.<br>In terms of methodology, it should be noted that the EMAS register shows the number of registrations. Participating organisations are free to include several locations under a single organisation registration (corporate registration) or to have their locations registered individually. Some organisations have had their sites abroad registered in Germany. These are present in the EMAS register, but they are not included in the number of EMAS locations recorded here.<br>In 2019, there were 2,176 EMAS locations registered in Germany. This equates to an increase of 11% compared with 2005. Considered over the last five years, the indicator has been gradually moving in the direction of the target. Nevertheless, if that trend continues unchanged, the goal for 2030 will not be achieved.<br>The registered organisations employed a total of 988,401 people in 2019. This equates to an decline of 2.8% compared with 2005.<br>The 2,176 EMAS locations on the register in 2019 belong to 1,150 German organisations and one organisation headquartered abroad. The number of German organisations had shrunk by 22.9% since 2005. Furthermore, those organisations were very well spread throughout the country. The majority were based in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (347) and Bavaria (288), followed by North Rhine-Westphalia (105). In contrast, there were just two registered organisations in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Divided by sector, the distribution in 2019 was as follows: 38.3% of the German organisations represented the manufacturing industry, 9.4% miscellaneous services, 8.0% the education sector and 7.6% the hospitality industry. It should be noted that some of the organisations belong to more than one sector.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.dihk.de/de\">Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.dihk.de/de\">German EMAS Advisory Board based on data from the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.dihk.de/de\"><img src=\"ttps://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/logosEn/dihk.png\" alt=\"Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationAssociation of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_1":"https://www.emas.de/statistiken/","source_url_text_1":"EMAS statistics (only available in German)","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"12.2 EMAS eco-management","weather_indicator_1_year_a":"2021","weather_indicator_1_year_b":"2020","weather_indicator_1_year_c":"2019","weather_indicator_1_year_d":"2018","weather_indicator_1_year_e":"2017","weather_indicator_1_year_f":"2016","weather_indicator_1_year_g":"2015","weather_indicator_1_target":"5,000 locations of organisations by 2030","weather_indicator_1_item_a":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_item_b":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_item_c":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_item_d":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_item_e":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_item_f":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_item_g":"Wolke","data_show_map":true,"copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2022","data_footnote":"EMAS = Eco-Management and Audit Scheme.","graph_title":"Use of EMAS eco-management system in Germany","graph_annotations":[{"value":5000.0,"label":{"content":"Target 2030","position":"left"},"preset":"target_line"}],"span_gaps":true,"show_line":true,"graph_type":"line","graph_limits":null,"national_geographical_coverage":"Germany","page_content":"\n\n<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <h3>\n      <a href=\"https://dnsTestEnvironment.github.io/dns-indicators/en/status\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Wolke.png\" title=\"Text will follow soon\" alt=\"Wettersymbol\"/>\n      </a>\n    </h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"my-header-note\">\n  </div>\n</div>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-08-24","national_data_updated_date":"2022-07-08","indicator_number":"12.2.a","target_number":"12.2","goal_number":"12","language":"en"}
