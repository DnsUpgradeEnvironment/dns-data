national_indicator_available: Final energy productivity and primary energy consumption        

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator “Final energy productivity” shows the trend of value added per unit of final energy used. The concept of “final energy” refers to the part of the energy that is used energetically in terms of thermal or electric energy in the production sectors for the manufacturing of goods or by households.<br>The indicator ”Primary energy consumption” specifies how much energy was consumed by a country in the energy sectors for conversion purposes on the one hand, and by production activities, transport and households on the other.        

dns_indicator_definition_new: The final energy productivity indicator (7.1.a) shows the development of value added per unit of final energy used compared to the base year 2008. The term ‘final energy’ refers to the portion of energy that is available as thermal or electrical energy for the production of goods or for use in private households. Indicator 7.1.b shows the development of primary energy consumption compared to the base year 2008. Primary energy consumption is calculated as the sum of final energy consumption, non-energy consumption and the balance in the conversion balance. In the conversion balance, the conversion of energy sources is shown as input and output. Own consumption in the conversion areas and flare and line losses are also recognised in the conversion balance.        

dns_indicator_intention: Along with the expansion of renewable energies, the reduction of energy consumption through increased energy efficiency represents the second supporting pillar of the energy transition. The goal is to achieve a high level of economic output while using as little energy as possible. Saving energy protects the climate and the environment, it helps to improve the security of supply and the industrial competitiveness.<br>According to the Federal Government’s energy concept, final energy productivity is to be increased by 2.1&nbsp;% annually or 139&nbsp;% in total in the period 2008&nbsp;to 2050. At the same time, primary energy consumption is to be reduced by 20&nbsp;% by 2020, by 30&nbsp;% by 2030, and by 50&nbsp;% by 2050, compared with 2008.        

dns_political_intention: Reducing energy consumption by increasing energy efficiency is the second main pillar of the energy transition alongside the expansion of renewable energies. The aim is to achieve a high level of economic performance with as little energy as possible. Saving energy protects the climate and the environment, contributes to improving security of supply and the competitiveness of industry.
