national_indicator_available: Final energy productivity and primary energy consumption        

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator “Final energy productivity” shows the trend of value added per unit of final energy used. The concept of “final energy” refers to the part of the energy that is used energetically in terms of thermal or electric energy in the production sectors for the manufacturing of goods or by households.<br>The indicator ”Primary energy consumption” specifies how much energy was consumed by a country in the energy sectors for conversion purposes on the one hand, and by production activities, transport and households on the other.        

dns_indicator_definition_new: The final energy productivity indicator (7.1.a) shows the development of value added per unit of final energy used compared to the base year 2008. The term ‘final energy’ refers to the portion of energy that is available as thermal or electrical energy for the production of goods or for use in private households. Indicator 7.1.b shows the development of primary energy consumption compared to the base year 2008. Primary energy consumption is calculated as the sum of final energy consumption, non-energy consumption and the balance in the conversion balance. In the conversion balance, the conversion of energy sources is shown as input and output. Own consumption in the conversion areas and flare and line losses are also recognised in the conversion balance.        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: Reducing energy consumption by increasing energy efficiency is the second main pillar of the energy transition alongside the expansion of renewable energies. The aim is to achieve a high level of economic performance with as little energy as possible. Saving energy protects the climate and the environment, contributes to improving security of supply and the competitiveness of industry.

content_and_progress: '<p><b style= "color: #fcc30b; font-size: large">7.1.a, b Final energy productivity and primary energy consumption</b><br><br>When considering energy consumption, a distinction is made between primary and final energy:<br><br>• 	Primary energy refers to the energy contained in natural energy sources such as natural gas, petroleum, coal, or uranium before their conversion. Energy obtained from renewable sources also counts as primary energy.<br><br>• 	Final energy is the portion of primary energy available to the final consumer in the form of electricity, district heating, natural gas, or fuels. It results from the primary energy minus the losses incurred during conversion, transport, and storage.<br><br><b>7.1.a Final energy productivity</b><br><br>Final energy productivity describes the relationship between economic value added&nbsp;–&nbsp;measured as gross domestic product (<abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>)&nbsp;–&nbsp;and final energy consumption. It serves as an indicator of energy efficiency in the production of goods, the provision of services, and energy consumption in private households.<br><br>Because the indicator refers to final energy, losses during conversion, transport, and storage are not taken into account. Therefore, conclusions about the efficiency of energy conversion processes&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as the efficiency of power plants&nbsp;–&nbsp;or progress in energy transmission and storage are not possible.<br><br>According to preliminary results, final energy productivity increased by 31.8% between 2008&nbsp;and 2023, including 10.8&nbsp;percentage points in 2022&nbsp;and 2023&nbsp;alone. This means that the politically set target of a continuous increase was achieved both last year and on a multi-year average.<br><br>Until 2019, the indicator"s development was primarily driven by rising <abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr> (+14.7&nbsp;% compared to 2008), while final energy consumption remained relatively constant (–3.0&nbsp;%). Between 2021&nbsp;and 2023, <abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr> increased only slightly, but at the same time, energy consumption fell significantly&nbsp;–&nbsp;from 94.2&nbsp;% to 87.5&nbsp;% of the 2008&nbsp;baseline. As a result, final energy productivity continued to increase despite stagnating <abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>.<br><br>Regional differences are clearly visible: In 2022, final energy productivity in Saxony-Anhalt was 249&nbsp;million euros per gigajoule&nbsp;–&nbsp;an increase of only 4.6% compared to 2008. Saxony-Anhalt thus recorded the lowest value in Germany, both in terms of final energy productivity itself and its development. The highest values were achieved by the city-states of Berlin (928&nbsp;million euros per gigajoule) and Hamburg (983&nbsp;million euros per gigajoule). Berlin also achieved the highest growth of all federal states, with 72.8&nbsp;% compared to 2008. <br><br>Total final energy consumption in 2023&nbsp;amounted to 8,163&nbsp;petajoules, compared to 9,327&nbsp;petajoules in 2008. Approximately 14&nbsp;% was accounted for by industry, commerce and services, 28&nbsp;% each by households and industry, and 31&nbsp;% by transport.<br><br><b>7.1.b 	Primary energy consumptio</b><br><br>Primary energy consumption encompasses the total energy content of all energy sources used domestically. This includes primary energy sources such as lignite and hard coal, mineral oil, natural gas, and energy from renewable sources. These are either used directly or converted into secondary energy sources such as electricity, district heating, gasoline, or diesel.<br><br>The calculation is based on the total domestically produced energy sources plus the balance of imports and exports, as well as inventory changes, less reserves stored at sea. The basis is the energy balances of the Working Group on Energy Balances (<abbr title="Energy Balance Association" tabindex="0">AGEB</abbr>), supplemented by other data sources .<br><br>In contrast to final energy productivity, this indicator does not consider economic reference values, but only consumption . Since it is based on primary energy, efficiency improvements in the conversion of fossil fuels&nbsp;–&nbsp;particularly in electricity generation&nbsp;–&nbsp;are also included. However, this does not clearly determine whether changes in the indicator are due to changes in energy consumption or to developments in energy generation, conversion, and transport. When electricity is generated from renewable sources, the energy produced is counted as primary energy, so efficiency improvements in these plants do not have a direct impact on the indicator.<br><br>Between 2008&nbsp;and 2024, primary energy consumption fell According to preliminary data, the energy consumption will be 72.9&nbsp;% of the baseline. If the trend of recent years continues, the politically defined target of reducing primary energy consumption by at least 39.3&nbsp;% compared to 2008&nbsp;by 2030&nbsp;–&nbsp;expected to be achieved ahead of schedule.<br><br>Here, too, there are clear regional differences: While primary energy consumption While in Saxony it rose to 102.8&nbsp;% of the 2008&nbsp;baseline in 2022&nbsp;, in Schleswig-Holstein it fell to 73.8&nbsp;%.</p>'
