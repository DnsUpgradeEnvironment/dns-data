The gross domestic product (<abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>) at current prices is calculated by the Federal Statistical Office as part of the national accounts system.<br><br>The debt-to-<abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr> ratio is influenced by both the condition of public budgets and overall economic performance. Assuming constant government debt, the debt ratio will fall more quickly the stronger <abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr> growth becomes. Conversely, the debt ratio may increase even if absolute debt levels decline, provided that <abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr> falls more sharply in the same period. Not included in this calculation is implicit government debt&nbsp;–&nbsp;<abbr title="that is to say (id est)" tabindex="0">i.e.</abbr> future payment obligations the government has pledged but not yet disbursed.<br><br>Between 2003&nbsp;and 2018, Germany’s debt-to-<abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr> ratio remained above the <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr> reference threshold. Following the consolidation of public finances, the ratio declined from 67.1&nbsp;% in 2005&nbsp;to 63.7&nbsp;% in 2007, before rising again to a peak of 81.0&nbsp;% in 2010. This increase must be viewed in the context of the financial and economic crisis. Since 2012, the debt-to-<abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr> ratio steadily decreased, falling below the Maastricht reference value of 60&nbsp;% for the first time in 2019, reaching 58.7&nbsp;%. Due to the <abbr title="Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2" tabindex="0">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic, the ratio increased again, reaching 68.1&nbsp;% in 2021. In the current reporting year of 2024, preliminary calculations indicate a debt-to-<abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr> ratio of 62.5&nbsp;%.<br><br>In European comparison, fifteen <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr> Member States were below the 60&nbsp;% reference value in 2024. The average debt-to-<abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr> ratio in the <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr> stood at 81.0&nbsp;%. The highest ratios were recorded in Greece (153.6&nbsp;%) and Italy (135.3&nbsp;%), while Estonia reported the lowest ratio at 23.6&nbsp;%.<br><br>While consolidated government debt had been rising continuously since 1991, it decreased for the first time in 2013&nbsp;and continued to fall from 2015&nbsp;onwards. In 2019, the consolidated debt of the overall public budget amounted to 2,076&nbsp;billion euros. As a result of the <abbr title="Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2" tabindex="0">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic and the war of aggression against Ukraine, this figure rose to 2,689&nbsp;billion euros by 2024&nbsp;–&nbsp;the highest level since 1991. Per capita, this corresponds to approximately 31,740&nbsp;euros of debt per person in 2024, compared with 7,765&nbsp;euros in 1991.<br><br>Non-consolidated debt amounted to 2,728&nbsp;billion euros in 2024. Of this total, 69.4&nbsp;% was federal debt, 23.4&nbsp;% was debt held by the Länder, 7.1&nbsp;% by local authorities, and 0.1&nbsp;% by the social insurance system.<br><br>On the asset side of the government’s balance sheet, these liabilities are offset by assets&nbsp;–&nbsp;both tangible and financial. According to the Federal Statistical Office’s national balance of assets, fixed assets in 2023&nbsp;were valued (after depreciation) at 2,022&nbsp;billion euros. The largest category of government-owned assets was buildings and structures&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as roads, schools, and public buildings&nbsp;–&nbsp;valued at 1,709&nbsp;billion euros. Financial assets in 2023&nbsp;amounted to 1,546&nbsp;billion euros, with securities accounting for the largest share at 53.6&nbsp;%.</p>'
