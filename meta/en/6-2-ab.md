national_indicator_available: Development cooperation for access to drinking water and sanitation        

dns_indicator_definition:         

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicators represent the number of people reached (in millions) who have received new or improved access to drinking water (6.2.a) and/or sanitation or, since 2022, basic sanitation or wastewater treatment (6.2.b) directly through German support (<abbr title="Financial cooperation" tabindex="0">FC</abbr> commitments) in the respective reporting year.        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: An inadequate supply of drinking water and sanitary facilities has far-reaching consequences for nutrition, human health and sustainable economic development in partner countries. As part of its international cooperation, the German government therefore supports projects that provide access to drinking water and sanitation.        

political_target: '6.2.a: 6 million people per year by 2030<br>6.2.b: 4 million people per year by 2030'        

type_target: '6.2.a: Consistent target every year<br>6.2.b: Consistent target every year'

content_and_progress: '<p><b style= "color: #26bde2; font-size: large">6.2.a, b Development cooperation for access to drinking water and sanitation</b><br><br>The two indicators on development cooperation in the field of drinking water supply and sanitation are based on data provided by the <abbr title="Reconstruction Loan Corporation" tabindex="0">KfW</abbr> Development Bank (<abbr title="Reconstruction Loan Corporation" tabindex="0">KfW</abbr>). They capture the number of people reached through <abbr title="Reconstruction Loan Corporation" tabindex="0">KfW</abbr>-funded projects, provided these are mandated by German federal ministries. Projects implemented by <abbr title="Reconstruction Loan Corporation" tabindex="0">KfW</abbr> on behalf of, and with funding from, the European Union (<abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr>) or other donor countries are excluded, as are projects carried out by other actors such as the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (<abbr title="German Agency for International Cooperation" tabindex="0">GIZ</abbr>) <abbr title="Company with limited liability" tabindex="0">GmbH</abbr>, the German federal states, or private organisations.<br><br>Both indicators refer exclusively to the planned figures for new financing commitments (grant and loan agreements) for drinking water and sanitation projects at the time the contract is signed between <abbr title="Reconstruction Loan Corporation" tabindex="0">KfW</abbr> and the respective partner country. <abbr title="Reconstruction Loan Corporation" tabindex="0">KfW</abbr> estimates how many people, upon completion of the construction works, are expected to benefit from new or improved access to drinking water and sanitation. Whether these people are actually reached can only be reliably determined after the infrastructure is operational and is therefore not captured by the indicators.<br><br>As an individual can gain both new or improved access to drinking water and to sanitation, double counting between the two indicators, as well as over time, is possible. The funds committed by <abbr title="Reconstruction Loan Corporation" tabindex="0">KfW</abbr> consist of grants and loans financed either from the federal budget or raised on the capital market. The recipients are typically developing and emerging countries, creating a link to Indicator 17.1&nbsp;"Official development assistance as a proportion of gross national income".<br><br>In 2019, the methodology and data basis of the indicators were revised. Until then, both directly reached people&nbsp;–&nbsp;for example, through a household connection&nbsp;–&nbsp;and indirectly reached people&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as the total population of a country supported through a sector reform programme&nbsp;–&nbsp;were counted. Since the revision, only directly reached people have been included. To illustrate the ratio between directly and indirectly reached people: in 2017, a total of 28.6&nbsp;million people were reached, of whom 19.1&nbsp;million were direct beneficiaries. In 2018, there were 15.2&nbsp;million direct beneficiaries out of a total of 60.3&nbsp;million people reached.<br><br>Another methodological change concerns the inclusion of beneficiaries in multilateral projects: since the revision, their number has been counted proportionally according to the German financial share in the overall measure.<br><br>Until 2018, <abbr title="Reconstruction Loan Corporation" tabindex="0">KfW</abbr>’s planned figures for the number of people to be provided with access to drinking water and sanitation with German support consistently exceeded the politically defined target of 10&nbsp;million people per year. With the introduction of the revised methodology, the target for new or improved access to drinking water was set at 6&nbsp;million people annually. In 2023, the planned figure was 10.2&nbsp;million people&nbsp;–&nbsp;significantly exceeding the target, as in each of the four preceding years.<br><br>Since 2019, the target for the number of people with new or improved access to basic sanitation or wastewater treatment has been 4&nbsp;million people per year. This target has only been exceeded in 2019&nbsp;and 2022. For 2023, the corresponding planned figure is 3.0&nbsp;million people reached.</p>'

data_footnotes: Due to methodological changes, the results from 2019&nbsp;are only comparable with previous years to a limited extent.<br>• Beginning in 2019, the time series for drinking water supply and sanitation will be reported separately.<br>• The data is based on a special evaluation and is not publicly available.
