This indicator is marked as not applicable for the provision of national time series. Possible reasons are:
-	The indicator is a global indicator that is to say the provision of national data for this indicator would not be meaningful.
-	The indicator or the corresponding target refers to a specific group of countries (for example small island developing states), to which Germany does not belong.
-	The indicator is classified as not applicable due to other reasons, for example following the relevant European classification by Eurostat.
