national_indicator_available: Government deficit, structural deficit        

dns_indicator_definition: The indicators 8.2.a and 8.2.b show the financial balance of general government (deficit or surplus) and the structural financial balance as a percentage of gross domestic product (<abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>) at current prices. The public financial balance is calculated as government revenue minus government expenditure, measured on a national accounts basis. The annual structural balance refers to the part of the financial balance that is not attributable to cyclical fluctuations and temporary effects. A negative financial balance is known as a deficit; a positive as a surplus.        

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicators show the government net lending/borrowing (8.2.a) and the structural net lending/borrowing (8.2.b) in relation to gross domestic product (<abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>) at current prices (in per cent). The government's net lending/net borrowing is calculated from government revenue less government expenditure as defined in the national accounts. The annual structural net lending/borrowing is the part of the net lending/borrowing that is not attributable to cyclical fluctuations and temporary effects. A negative net lending/borrowing balance is referred to as a deficit, a positive net lending/borrowing balance as a surplus.        

dns_indicator_intention: Sound public finances are an essential element of a sustainable fiscal policy. A policy that relies too heavily on borrowing to fund current public expenditure and then passes this debt on to future generations is simply not sustainable.<br>According to the convergence criteria for the European Union, known as the Maastricht criteria, the annual government deficit should be less than 3&nbsp;% of <abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>. The structural deficit must not exceed 0.5&nbsp;% of <abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>. These are the stipulations of the European Stability and Growth Pact. The guiding principle of the structurally balanced budget has also been enshrined in Germany’s Basic Law since 2009&nbsp;(Article 109, referred to as the debt brake).        

dns_political_intention: Sound public finances are an important contribution to a sustainable financial policy. A policy that would finance current government spending excessively through new debt and leave the repayment of this debt to future generations alone would not be sustainable.        

political_target: '8.2.a: Annual government deficit of less than 3&nbsp;per cent of gross domestic product (<abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>); to be maintained until 2030<br>8.2.b: Structurally balanced government budget, general government structural deficit of no more than 0.5&nbsp;per cent of gross domestic product (<abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>); to be maintained until 2030'

target_description: Each year, the net lending/borrowing ratio (8.2.a) should be at least -3&nbsp;per cent of gross domestic product and the structural net lending/borrowing ratio (8.2.b) at least -0.5&nbsp;per cent of gross domestic product.<br><br><br>Based on the target formulation, both politically defined target values should be met every year. While indicator 8.2.a fell short of the target value in 2024, the average development of the indicator over the last six years points towards an increase. Indicator 8.2.a is therefore rated as "slightly cloudy" for 2024.<br><br><br>Indicator 8.2.b was significantly above the target value in 2024. The average development over the last six years also points to a further deterioration. Accordingly, indicator 8.2.b for the year 2024&nbsp;is assessed as "Thunderstorm".
