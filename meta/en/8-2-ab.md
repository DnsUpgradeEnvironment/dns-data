national_indicator_available: Government deficit and structural deficit        

dns_indicator_definition: The indicators 8.2.a and 8.2.b show the financial balance of general government (deficit or surplus) and the structural financial balance as a percentage of gross domestic product (<abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>) at current prices. The public financial balance is calculated as government revenue minus government expenditure, measured on a national accounts basis. The annual structural balance refers to the part of the financial balance that is not attributable to cyclical fluctuations and temporary effects. A negative financial balance is known as a deficit; a positive as a surplus.        

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicators show the government net lending/borrowing (8.2.a) and the structural net lending/borrowing (8.2.b) in relation to gross domestic product (<abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>) at current prices (in per cent). The government's net lending/net borrowing is calculated from government revenue less government expenditure as defined in the national accounts. The annual structural net lending/borrowing is the part of the net lending/borrowing that is not attributable to cyclical fluctuations and temporary effects. A negative net lending/borrowing balance is referred to as a deficit, a positive net lending/borrowing balance as a surplus.        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: Sound public finances are an important contribution to a sustainable financial policy. A policy that would finance current government spending excessively through new debt and leave the repayment of this debt to future generations alone would not be sustainable.

content_and_progress: '<p><b style= "color: #a21942; font-size: large">8.2.a, b Government deficit and structural deficit</b><br><br>The fiscal balance of the government refers to the difference between government revenues and expenditures within a specific period&nbsp;–&nbsp;usually one year. If the balance negative, expenditures exceed revenues , which is called the government deficit . In the (nominal) fiscal balance Economic fluctuations are regularly reflected&nbsp;–&nbsp;for example, through higher expenditure relative to income in economic downturns or through higher income compared to expenditure in growth phases.<br><br>The so-called structural fiscal balance attempts to eliminate temporary cyclical effects. It shows how high the deficit or surplus would be if the economy were operating under cyclically neutral conditions&nbsp;–&nbsp;<abbr title="that is to say (id est)" tabindex="0">i.e.</abbr>, at its production potential. The structural fiscal balance thus provides information about the long-term sustainability of public finances&nbsp;–&nbsp;independent of short-term economic fluctuations.<br><br>The indicators serve as instruments of fiscal and budgetary policy, particularly for assessing fiscal stability and compliance with debt rules&nbsp;–&nbsp;for example, those under the Stability and Growth Pact of the European Union (<abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr>). The nominal fiscal balance is calculated by the Federal Statistical Office according to the requirements of the European System of Accounts (<abbr title="European System of National and Regional Accounts" tabindex="0">ESA</abbr>). This includes the finances of all regional authorities&nbsp;–&nbsp;<abbr title="that is to say (id est)" tabindex="0">i.e.</abbr>, the federal government, the states, and municipalities&nbsp;–&nbsp;as well as the social security system. The structural fiscal balance, on the other hand, is determined by the Federal Ministry of Finance (<abbr title="Federal Ministry of Finance" tabindex="0">BMF</abbr>).<br><br>Both indicators are presented in relation to gross domestic product (<abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>) in order to classify a country"s fiscal situation in relation to the size of its economic output . This presentation enables better comparability both over time and between different countries .<br><br>fiscal balance is subject to significant fluctuations. The lowest values since 1991, at –4.4&nbsp;% of <abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>, were recorded in 2010&nbsp;and 2020&nbsp;–&nbsp;immediately following the global financial and economic crisis of 2008/2009&nbsp;and during the <abbr title="Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2" tabindex="0">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic. Both events led to additional government spending, for example for economic stimulus packages and aid programs, as well as lower revenues due to economic downturns. These developments are reflected accordingly in the indicator.<br><br>From 2013&nbsp;to 2019, government revenues exceeded expenditures, resulting in positive fiscal balances. The government achieved its highest surplus to date in In 2018, it amounted to 64.7&nbsp;billion euros, corresponding to 1.9&nbsp;% of <abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>.<br><br>Since its low in 2020, the fiscal balance has only partially recovered and remains negative. In 2024, the balance amounted to&nbsp;–&nbsp;119&nbsp;billion euros, or&nbsp;–&nbsp;2.8&nbsp;% of <abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>. The politically set target of limiting the government deficit to a maximum of 3&nbsp;% of <abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr> was thus met in 2024. However, the long-term trend of the indicator points to a deterioration in the fiscal situation.<br><br>In a European comparison, Germany"s government deficit in 2023&nbsp;was below the <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr> average of 3.5&nbsp;%. Twelve Member States reported a higher deficit than Germany, and ten countries a lower deficit. Four countries&nbsp;–&nbsp;Denmark (+3.3&nbsp;%), Cyprus (+&nbsp;2.0&nbsp;%), Ireland (+1.5&nbsp;%), and Portugal (+1.2&nbsp;%)&nbsp;–&nbsp;achieved a positive fiscal balance.<br><br>The pattern of the structural fiscal balance is naturally similar to that of the nominal fiscal balance, which is why a detailed description is omitted. However, by excluding temporary cyclical effects, short-term extreme fluctuations in the indicator are less frequent.<br><br>The politically set target is for the annual structural deficit to not exceed 0.5&nbsp;% of <abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>. However, in 2024, as in previous years, the structural deficit was significantly above the target at 1.9&nbsp;% of <abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr> .</p>'

target_description: Each year, the net lending/borrowing ratio (8.2.a) should be at least -3&nbsp;per cent of gross domestic product and the structural net lending/borrowing ratio (8.2.b) at least -0.5&nbsp;per cent of gross domestic product.<br><br><br>Based on the target formulation, both politically defined target values should be met every year. While indicator 8.2.a fell short of the target value in 2024, the average development of the indicator over the last six years points towards an increase. Indicator 8.2.a is therefore rated as "slightly cloudy" for 2024.<br><br><br>Indicator 8.2.b was significantly above the target value in 2024. The average development over the last six years also points to a further deterioration. Accordingly, indicator 8.2.b for the year 2024&nbsp;is assessed as "Thunderstorm".
