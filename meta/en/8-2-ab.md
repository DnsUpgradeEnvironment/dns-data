national_indicator_available: Government deficit, structural deficit        

dns_indicator_definition: The indicators 8.2.a and 8.2.b show the financial balance of general government (deficit or surplus) and the structural financial balance as a percentage of gross domestic product (<abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>) at current prices. The public financial balance is calculated as government revenue minus government expenditure, measured on a national accounts basis. The annual structural balance refers to the part of the financial balance that is not attributable to cyclical fluctuations and temporary effects. A negative financial balance is known as a deficit; a positive as a surplus.        

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicators show the government net lending/borrowing (8.2.a) and the structural net lending/borrowing (8.2.b) in relation to gross domestic product (<abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>) at current prices (in per cent). The government's net lending/net borrowing is calculated from government revenue less government expenditure as defined in the national accounts. The annual structural net lending/borrowing is the part of the net lending/borrowing that is not attributable to cyclical fluctuations and temporary effects. A negative net lending/borrowing balance is referred to as a deficit, a positive net lending/borrowing balance as a surplus.        

dns_indicator_intention: Sound public finances are an essential element of a sustainable fiscal policy. A policy that relies too heavily on borrowing to fund current public expenditure and then passes this debt on to future generations is simply not sustainable.<br>According to the convergence criteria for the European Union, known as the Maastricht criteria, the annual government deficit should be less than 3&nbsp;% of <abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>. The structural deficit must not exceed 0.5&nbsp;% of <abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>. These are the stipulations of the European Stability and Growth Pact. The guiding principle of the structurally balanced budget has also been enshrined in Germany’s Basic Law since 2009&nbsp;(Article 109, referred to as the debt brake).        

dns_political_intention: Sound public finances are an important contribution to a sustainable financial policy. A policy that would finance current government spending excessively through new debt and leave the repayment of this debt to future generations alone would not be sustainable.

content_and_progress: '<p style="opacity: 0.5"><b>Text from the <a href="https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/Publikationen/Indikatorenberichte/2022.pdf">Indicator Report 2022&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>The method used to calculate <abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr> and the financial balance of general government is laid down in the European System of National and Regional Accounts (<abbr title="European System of National and Regional Accounts" tabindex="0">ESA</abbr>) and is applied by the Federal Statistical Office. The structural financial balance, on the other hand, is determined by the Federal Ministry of Finance. The calculation of government net borrowing takes into account the finances of the public authorities, that is to say the Federal Government, the Länder and local government, and the finances of the social insurance system.<br><br>In 2012, the Government achieved an overall surplus of 0.3&nbsp;billion euros, which was the first positive balance since the financial and economic crisis of 2008/2009. Financial balance increased to 65.6&nbsp;billion euros or 1.9&nbsp;% of <abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr> until 2018. In 2019, the financial surplus amounted to 53.2&nbsp;billion euros and 1.5&nbsp;% of <abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr> (preliminary data). A financial deficit in 2020&nbsp;and 2021&nbsp;emerged in consequence of the <abbr title="Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2" tabindex="0">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic. The deficit in 2020&nbsp;amounted to 147.6&nbsp;billion euros. Since 1991, only 1995&nbsp;had a higher deficit (178.7&nbsp;billion euros). A European comparison of financial deficits in 2021&nbsp;reveals that Germany’s negative financial balance of 3.7&nbsp;% of <abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr> was below European average of 4.6&nbsp;%. Twelve countries had a lower deficit ratio than Germany; 14&nbsp;countries were above. Denmark (+&nbsp;3.6&nbsp;%) and Luxembourg (+&nbsp;0.8&nbsp;%) even generated a financial surplus.<br><br>In 2021, the Government generated an overall deficit of 134.3&nbsp;billion euros. The federal deficit came to 145.9&nbsp;billion euros. At the same time, Länder, local governments and social insurance yet again recorded an aggregate surplus. The balances for the Länder (2.8&nbsp;billion euros), the social insurance fund (4.3&nbsp;billion euros) and local government (4.6&nbsp;billion euros) were also positive. The national budget in 2021&nbsp;showed a structural deficit of 2.5&nbsp;% of <abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr> (preliminary data). This meant that the <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr> convergence criteria for both the government deficit and the structural deficit had not been met in 2021&nbsp;as previous year: in 2020, the federal deficit was 87.4&nbsp;billion euros, that of the Länder was 30.9&nbsp;billion euros and social insurance fund 34.8&nbsp;billion euros. Only local governments reported a surplus of 5.5&nbsp;billion euros in 2020.<br><br>In 2020, government revenues decreased for a short time, however, they increased again in 2021&nbsp;and were 5.9&nbsp;% above the value in 2019. Government spendings increased by 18.1&nbsp;% in the same period. The largest item on the expenditure side of the national accounts are social benefits other than social transfers in kind. These accounted for 33.1&nbsp;% of government spendings (610.9&nbsp;billion euros). Social benefits in kind accounted for 17.9&nbsp;% (330.0&nbsp;billion euros). 70.4&nbsp;% of social benefits other than social transfers in kind fall under the heading of social insurance, primarily in the form of pensions (340&nbsp;billion euros); spendings on social benefits in kind predominantly incurred for statutory health insurance (249.9&nbsp;billion euros).</p>'

target_description: Each year, the net lending/borrowing ratio (8.2.a) should be at least -3&nbsp;per cent of gross domestic product and the structural net lending/borrowing ratio (8.2.b) at least -0.5&nbsp;per cent of gross domestic product.<br><br><br>Based on the target formulation, both politically defined target values should be met every year. While indicator 8.2.a fell short of the target value in 2024, the average development of the indicator over the last six years points towards an increase. Indicator 8.2.a is therefore rated as "slightly cloudy" for 2024.<br><br><br>Indicator 8.2.b was significantly above the target value in 2024. The average development over the last six years also points to a further deterioration. Accordingly, indicator 8.2.b for the year 2024&nbsp;is assessed as "Thunderstorm".
