national_indicator_available: Expansion of settlement and transport area        

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the average daily expansion of the area used for settlement and transport infrastructure in hectares per day.        

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator represents the average daily increase in settlement and transport area (in hectares per day).        

dns_indicator_intention: Land is a limited resource. It is subject to competition from various interests, including agriculture and forestry, settlement and transport, nature conservation, resource extraction and energy generation. The development of additional land for settlement and transport purposes is to be limited to an average of less than 30&nbsp;hectares per day by 2030. The goal is to establish a closed-loop land-use regime by 2050, meaning that, in net terms, no additional area will be developed for the purposes of settlement or transport.        

dns_political_intention: Land is a limited resource. Agriculture and forestry, settlement and transport, nature conservation, raw material extraction and energy production, for example, compete for its use. The use of additional land for settlement and transport purposes should therefore be limited.        

political_target: Reduction to an average of less than 30&nbsp;hectares per day by 2030; ‘net zero’ land consumption by 2050        

type_target: Goal with a specific target value

target_description: The increase in settlement and transport areas is to be reduced to a maximum of 30&nbsp;hectares per day by 2030&nbsp;(on average for the years 2027&nbsp;to 2030).<br><br><br>As the indicator 11.1.a is calculated as the average value for the year and the three preceding years, the politically defined target value must be achieved as an average for the years 2027&nbsp;to 2030. If the trend of the last six years were to continue, the indicator would only fall to around 42.4&nbsp;hectares per day by 2030. The remaining gap to the target value is therefore so large that indicator 11.1.a for 2022&nbsp;is rated as "Cloud".
