national_indicator_available: Expansion of settlement and transport area        

dns_indicator_definition:         

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator represents the average daily increase in settlement and transport area (in hectares per day).        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: Land is a limited resource. Agriculture and forestry, settlement and transport, nature conservation, raw material extraction and energy production, for example, compete for its use. The use of additional land for settlement and transport purposes should therefore be limited.        

political_target: Reduction to an average of less than 30&nbsp;hectares per day by 2030; "net zero" land consumption by 2050        

type_target: Goal with a specific target value

content_and_progress: '<p><b style= "color: #fd9d24; font-size: large">11.1.a Expansion of settlement and transport area</b><br><br>The indicator represents the average daily increase in settlement and transport area (SuV). Settlement area includes, among other things, residential building land, industrial and commercial land, land for public facilities, recreational areas, and cemeteries. Extraction land, <abbr title="that is to say (id est)" tabindex="0">i.e.</abbr> areas used for mining and quarrying, is also in principle part of the SuV, but is not taken into account in the calculation, as it is assumed that such land will be repurposed in the long term, for example as post-mining landscapes.<br><br>The indicator differs from the increase in sealed surfaces, as it encompasses, in addition to sealed areas, unbuilt and unsealed settlement land such as domestic gardens, parks, green spaces, roadside greenery, and other unsealed transport areas. According to calculations from the Environmental-Economic Accounts of the Länder, the sealing ratio of the SuV in Germany averaged around 45% in 2023.<br><br>The data source is the land survey by type of actual use (official land use statistics) of the Federal Statistical Office, based on the official cadastral register of the Länder. In recent years, harmonisation of the cadastral registers has led to reclassification of areas, even without actual changes in use. To offset these effects, a four-year moving average is applied, which includes the current reporting year and the three preceding years.<br><br>In 2016, a switch was made to a new land-use classification, which hampers comparability with earlier years. For example, areas previously classified as agricultural land were reassigned to new categories such as recreational areas or mixed-use areas. Therefore, a detailed breakdown by type of use for 2016&nbsp;is not available.<br><br>In 2023, the total SuV amounted to 50,788&nbsp;square kilometres<sup>1</sup>, of which around 64% were settlement areas and 36% transport areas. The proportion of SuV in the total area of Germany was approximately 14%. The largest land use was agriculture, with 179,891&nbsp;square kilometres (50.3%), followed by woodland with 106,886&nbsp;square kilometres (29.9%).<br><br>Between 2022&nbsp;and 2023, the SuV increased by 225&nbsp;square kilometres, while agricultural land decreased by 316&nbsp;square kilometres. At the same time, woodland increased by 91&nbsp;square kilometres. The expansion of the SuV thus occurred predominantly at the expense of agricultural land.<br><br>Between 2000&nbsp;and 2023, a total of 6,849&nbsp;square kilometres were converted into SuV&nbsp;–&nbsp;more than twice the size of Saarland and equivalent to around 1.91% of Germany’s total area.<br><br>The growth in SuV was driven primarily by the designation of new settlement areas: since 2000, 85% of the increase was attributable to settlement land, and 15% to transport land.<br><br>The four-year moving average of newly utilised land fell to a low of 49&nbsp;hectares per day by 2022, and most recently (2023) stood at 51&nbsp;hectares per day. The politically defined target of reducing daily land take to below 30&nbsp;hectares by 2030&nbsp;will not be met if the current trend continues.<br><br><small><sup>1</sup>The figures for annual values and the moving average from 2020&nbsp;onwards have been revised. During the period in question, the surveying authorities undertook extensive reclassification of vegetation areas to transport land, which, however, do not reflect actual changes in land use. The results presented here have been adjusted accordingly.</small></p>'

data_footnotes: 'Settlement and transport area: Due to methodological changes in the official survey of land (introduction of the official land register information system (<abbr title="Official land register information system" tabindex="0">ALKIS</abbr>) from the 2016&nbsp;reporting year), the results from 2016&nbsp;are only comparable with previous years to a limited extent (break in the time series).<br>• Settlement area (built on): Housing, industry and commerce (excluding exploitation area), public facilities.<br>• Recreation area, cemeteries: sports, recreation and leisure area, cemeteries.<br>• The figures for the annual values and the moving average from 2020&nbsp;onwards are revised. For the period mentioned, the surveying administration reclassified a large number of areas from vegetation to traffic areas, which do not correspond to any change in land use in reality. The present results have been adjusted for these reclassifications.'

target_description: The increase in settlement and transport areas is to be reduced to a maximum of 30&nbsp;hectares per day by 2030&nbsp;(on average for the years 2027&nbsp;to 2030).<br><br>As the indicator 11.1.a is calculated as the average value for the year and the three preceding years, the politically defined target value must be achieved as an average for the years 2027&nbsp;to 2030. If the trend of the last six years were to continue, the indicator would only fall to around 44&nbsp;hectares per day by 2030. The remaining gap to the target value is therefore so large that indicator 11.1.a for 2023&nbsp;is rated as "Cloud".
