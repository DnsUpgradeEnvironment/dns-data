national_indicator_available: Expansion of settlement and transport area        

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the average daily expansion of the area used for settlement and transport infrastructure in hectares per day.        

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator represents the average daily increase in settlement and transport area (in hectares per day).        

dns_indicator_intention: Land is a limited resource. It is subject to competition from various interests, including agriculture and forestry, settlement and transport, nature conservation, resource extraction and energy generation. The development of additional land for settlement and transport purposes is to be limited to an average of less than 30&nbsp;hectares per day by 2030. The goal is to establish a closed-loop land-use regime by 2050, meaning that, in net terms, no additional area will be developed for the purposes of settlement or transport.        

dns_political_intention: Land is a limited resource. Agriculture and forestry, settlement and transport, nature conservation, raw material extraction and energy production, for example, compete for its use. The use of additional land for settlement and transport purposes should therefore be limited.        

political_target: Reduction to an average of less than 30&nbsp;hectares per day by 2030; ‘net zero’ land consumption by 2050        

type_target: Goal with a specific target value

content_and_progress: '<p style="opacity: 0.5"><b>Text from the <a href="https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/Publikationen/Indikatorenberichte/2022.pdf">Indicator Report 2022&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>Settlement and transport area should not be equated with sealed land. Settlement land includes areas used for residential building, industry and commerce, public facilities, recreational amenities or cemeteries. It also covers land used for surface or sub-surface mining. However, mining land is not counted in the calculations for this indicator, as it ends up being reclaimed for other uses in the long term (<abbr title="for example (exempli gratia)" tabindex="0">e.g.</abbr> as renaturalised post-mining landscapes). Transport area is made up of four subcategories: road transport, rail, aviation and shipping. The indicator therefore refers not only to sealed areas but also to undeveloped and unsealed land. These include, for example, domestic gardens, parks and other green spaces. As calculated in the environmental economic accounts compiled by the Länder, the sealed share of their settlement and transport area is estimated at 45&nbsp;% on average (2020).<br><br>The indicator is derived from the area survey by type of actual use (official land-use statistics), which in turn is based on data from the official land register maintained by the Länder. Some areas of land have been reclassified in the official land register in recent years without any actual change in the way they are used. To balance out the effect this has on the statistics for any particular year, a four-year moving average is also shown, averaging out the year in question and the three preceding years. Moreover, the switch from the old to the new land-use classification system was completed in 2016, which affected the official land-use statistics such that the data for 2016&nbsp;are not directly comparable to those for previous years. It is for this reason that the overall indicator value for 2016&nbsp;is also not subdivided into types of settlement or transport use.<br><br>From 2000&nbsp;to 2020, 6,257&nbsp;<abbr title="Square kilometer" tabindex="0">km²</abbr> of land was converted into settlement and transport area. This is equivalent to more than twice the area of Saarland. The majority, 85&nbsp;%, was converted into settlement land, while 15&nbsp;% went to accommodate transport infrastructure.<br><br>The four-year moving average of previously undeveloped areas newly converted to settlement or transport area continuously decreased throughout the time series until 2019. This year, the four-year moving average was at 52&nbsp;hectares per day and increased to 54&nbsp;hectares per day in 2020. Considered for each reporting year separately, the value for new settlement or transport area was lowest in 2019, at 45&nbsp;hectares per day. The figure has risen again since then, to 58&nbsp;hectares per day in 2020.<br><br>In 2020, the area of settlement or transport use amounted to 50,196&nbsp;<abbr title="Square kilometer" tabindex="0">km²</abbr>, or 14&nbsp;% of the total area of Germany. The largest land types in Germany are agricultural land at 180,934&nbsp;<abbr title="Square kilometer" tabindex="0">km²</abbr> (51&nbsp;%) followed by woodland at 106,666&nbsp;<abbr title="Square kilometer" tabindex="0">km²</abbr> (30&nbsp;%). Settlement and transport area grew by 942&nbsp;<abbr title="Square kilometer" tabindex="0">km²</abbr> between 2016&nbsp;and 2020. Agricultural land shrank by 1,703&nbsp;<abbr title="Square kilometer" tabindex="0">km²</abbr> during the same period, while woodland grew by 496&nbsp;<abbr title="Square kilometer" tabindex="0">km²</abbr>. It can therefore be assumed that the increase in settlement and transport area was primarily at the expense of agricultural land.</p>'

target_description: The increase in settlement and transport areas is to be reduced to a maximum of 30&nbsp;hectares per day by 2030&nbsp;(on average for the years 2027&nbsp;to 2030).<br><br><br>As the indicator 11.1.a is calculated as the average value for the year and the three preceding years, the politically defined target value must be achieved as an average for the years 2027&nbsp;to 2030. If the trend of the last six years were to continue, the indicator would only fall to around 42.4&nbsp;hectares per day by 2030. The remaining gap to the target value is therefore so large that indicator 11.1.a for 2022&nbsp;is rated as "Cloud".
