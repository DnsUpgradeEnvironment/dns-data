national_indicator_available: Global environmental impact by private household consumption        

dns_indicator_definition: The impact caused to the environment around the world by private household consumption is shown here by three indicators. They are domestic and foreign energy consumption, emissions of carbon dioxide (<abbr title="Carbon dioxide" tabindex="0">CO₂</abbr>) and the use of raw materials in connection with the production and use of all goods destined for the consumption of private households in Germany.        

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator shows the global environmental impact of private household consumption compared to the base year 2010. Specifically, these are the domestic and foreign use of raw materials (12.1.ba), energy consumption (12.1.bb) and carbon dioxide (<abbr title="Carbon dioxide" tabindex="0">CO₂</abbr>) emissions (12.1.bc) in connection with the production and consumption of all goods for the consumption activities of domestic private households.        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: Private households account for a significant proportion of an economy's resource consumption through their consumption activities. However, this consumption is not only domestic, but also takes place indirectly abroad through the production of imported goods. The indicator therefore provides information on the global environmental impact of the consumption activities of private households. By reducing energy consumption, for example, resources are saved at home and abroad and climate-damaging carbon dioxide emissions are avoided.

content_and_progress: '<p><b style= "color: #bf8b2e; font-size: large">12.1.b Global environmental impact by private household consumption</b><br><br>The environmental impacts of private household consumption cannot be fully captured by a single indicator . Therefore, the analysis is based on three key influencing factors: raw material use (indicator 12.1.ba) and energy consumption. (Indicator 12.1.bb) caused by private household consumption and the CO 2&nbsp;emissions caused by household consumption (Indicator 12.1.bc). The underlying data come from the Environmental Economic Accounts (<abbr title="European Environment Agency" tabindex="0">EEA</abbr>).</p>'

target_description: The global environmental impact of private household consumption is to be reduced in all three areas (use of raw materials, energy consumption and <abbr title="Carbon dioxide" tabindex="0">CO₂</abbr> emissions).<br><br><br>Based on the target formulation, the value for all three indicators has fallen on average over the last six years and has therefore developed in the desired direction. In the last year (2022), the value of indicator 12.1.ba also fell, meaning that this indicator is rated as "Sun" for 2022. However, the values of indicators 12.1.bb and 12.1.bc increased between 2020&nbsp;and 2021, meaning that these indicators are rated as "slightly cloudy" for 2021.
