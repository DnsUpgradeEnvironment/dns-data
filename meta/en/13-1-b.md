national_indicator_available: International climate finance for the reduction of greenhouse gases and adaptation to climate change    

dns_indicator_definition: This indicator covers the financing of measures to reduce greenhouse gases, adapt to climate change and/or take climate-related action to preserve biodiversity and protect forests (specifically, projects for the conservation and sustainable management of forests as well as reforestation within the REDD+ framework). The measures chiefly take place in developing and emerging countries and are financed using German budgetc funds (including grant elements of development loans).    

dns_indicator_intention: The German Government’s aim is to raise its contribution to international climate finance to EUR 4 billion from public funds and grant elements of development loans by 2020, thereby doubling the target value for 2014, which was EUR 2 billion. In the decisions contained in the Addendum to the Paris Agreement, the industrialised countries reaffirmed their 2009 commitment to collectively provide USD 100 billion from public funds and from private sources mobilised by public funds, every year from 2020 to 2025, for work to mitigate and adapt to climate change in developing countries.    

data_state: The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of 30.11.2022. The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href="https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/publications/reports/en/2022.pdf">indicator report 2022</a>.

#content     
content_and_progress: '<i><a href="https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/publications/reports/en/2022.pdf">Text from the Indicator Report 2022 </a></i><br>The data for this indicator are derived from reporting carried out under the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Regulation on a mechanism for monitoring greenhouse gas emissions. The source of the annually collected data is the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, which also reports in this context on climate finance from other federal ministries. In the case of bilateral climate finance, expenditure is calculated on the basis of funds allocated; in the case of multilateral climate finance and contributions to energy and climate funds, it is calculated on the basis of funds actually paid. The indicator also includes climate finance that is attributed to donors pro rata on the basis of their contributions to multilateral funds managed by development banks. As climate finance primarily benefits developing countries, it is considered to be part of official development expenditure (see indicator 17.1).<br>In 2019, Germany committed or provided EUR 4.34 billion in public funds for international climate finance for the reduction of greenhouse gases and adaptation to climate change. Compared with the previous year, when climate finance amounted to EUR 3.37 billion, this represents an increase of 29%. The target for 2020 – to reach EUR 4 billion – was thus met a year early. In 2019, 44% of climate finance went to fund projects to reduce emissions, while 25% went towards adaptation to climate change. The remaining 31% was used to finance horizontal measures. As the horizontal measures serve both the reduction and adaptation efforts, the final split in 2019, as in previous years, shows more funds being used for emissions reduction (59%) than for adaptation (41%).<br>14% of climate finance, or EUR 588 million, was provided through multilateral channels in 2019. EUR 248 million of that can be attributed to Germany on the basis of the climate-related shares of Germany’s contributions to multilateral development banks, the Global Environment Facility and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. Germany provides the remaining EUR 340 million through multilateral institutions and contributions to international climate funds.<br>In addition to official climate finance from public funds, Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) and DEG (Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft) also provide climate-related loans with funds from the market. These represent mobilised public climate finance and are not included in the indicator. In 2019, the resources mobilised in this way amounted to approximately EUR 2.47 billion, compared with EUR 3.25 billion the previous year. Here too, more funding went towards emissions reduction (86%) than adaptation (14%).'
