national_indicator_available: Number of projects to secure, register and destroy small arms and light weapons carried out by Germany in affected regions of the world    

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the number of projects to secure, register and destroy small arms and light weapons (SALW) carried out in Africa, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia with German financial support.    

dns_indicator_intention: There can be no sustainable development without peace and no peace without sustainable development – as emphasised in the preamble to the 2030&nbsp;Agenda for Sustainable Development. With the measures covered by this indicator, Germany contributes to peacekeeping in a specific and tangible way. The goal is for Germany to carry out at least 15&nbsp;projects to secure, register and destroy SALW each year.    

data_state: The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of 30.11.2022. The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href="https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/publications/reports/en/2022.pdf">indicator report 2022</a>.    

indicator_name: Number of projects to secure, register and destroy small arms and light weapons carried out by Germany in affected regions of the world    
section: Peace and security    
postulate: Taking practical action to combat proliferation, especially of small arms

content_and_progress: '<i>Text from the <a href="https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/publications/reports/en/2022.pdf">Indicator Report 2022&nbsp;</a></i><br><br>The data for the indicator come from a special evaluation by the Federal Foreign Office. This special evaluation found that the number of projects run per year rose from 8&nbsp;in 2006&nbsp;to 31&nbsp;in 2019. According to the evaluation, the goal of Germany involving itself through at least 15&nbsp;projects annually was already achieved for the first time in 2012. With the exception of 2013, that target was also reached or even exceeded in the years that followed. The regional focuses of Germany’s involvement were in East and West Africa, the Western Balkans and Ukraine. Other projects were supported in Latin America and the Caribbean. It is possible that projects with run-times longer than one year were counted more than once.<br><br>The projects reported are not all financed exclusively by the Federal Foreign Office but may also receive third-party funds. The indicator therefore includes those projects only partially funded from the public purse. Notably, the number of projects carried out says nothing about their scale or their level of success. Clearly formulated and communicated criteria are essential, moreover, for a project to be unequivocally categorised as in line with the indicator’s aims. The German Government’s Annual Disarmament Report contains a list of projects with the objective of SALW control, alongside their sources of funding. Their number differs from those reported for this indicator. One reason for this may be the particular focus of individual projects, which affects whether they are taken into account. This means that the indicator depicts more than the extent of state involvement in these projects.<br><br>In accordance with the guidelines on statistical reporting issued by its Development Assistance Committee, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (<abbr title="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development">OECD</abbr>) also publishes detailed figures on projects for reintegration and SALW control (CRS Purpose Code 15240). There are some discrepancies here too, which may arise from a project, though its objective is SALW control, being part of a larger project with a focus which precludes its inclusion in this category.<br><br>If the indicator were based on the number of projects counted in the above-mentioned <abbr title="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development">OECD</abbr> category, the target of at least 15&nbsp;projects would have been reached in 2006&nbsp;and every year since 2016. The target value would not have been achieved in the intervening years. In 2019, the <abbr title="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development">OECD</abbr> counted 22&nbsp;projects. However, those projects also included measures for reintegrating former combatants from armed groups into society. Without such reintegration projects, the number of project exclusively or chiefly intended to combat SALW would be lower.'
