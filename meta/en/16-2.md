dns_indicator_definition:         

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator represents the total number of people who have been trained by experts from the Bundeswehr since 2024&nbsp;to strengthen the control of small arms and light weapons and related ammunition (including securing, registering and destroying small arms and light weapons) in particularly affected regions of the world.        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: There can be no sustainable development without peace and no peace without sustainable development &#8209; this is emphasised in the preamble to the 2030&nbsp;Agenda for Sustainable Development. By training personnel to strengthen small arms control and ammunition security, Germany is making a contribution to peacebuilding in a specific area.        

political_target: From 2024&nbsp;to 2030, training of at least 1,000&nbsp;people by experts from the Bundeswehr        

type_target: Goal with a specific target value

content_and_progress: '<p><b style= "color: #00689d; font-size: large">16.2&nbsp;Von der Bundeswehr ausgebildetes Personal zur Stärkung der Kleinwaffenkontrolle und Munitionssicherheit</b><br><br>xxx<br><br>The control of small arms and ammunition is a component of international arms control policy. Inadequate security measures regarding small arms and ammunition can lead to an escalation of conflicts and the illicit proliferation of weapons. The Bundeswehr contributes to this effort as part of its security policy responsibility by deploying experts in this field to train personnel in various regions of the world to strengthen small arms control and ammunition security.<br><br>This indicator represents the total number of people trained by the Bundeswehr in the areas of small arms control and ammunition security since 2024. The data is based on a special evaluation by the Bundeswehr Center for Verification Tasks.<br><br>The training covers topics such as storage security, weapons identification, ammunition transport, and documentation. A distinction is made between training in small arms control (identification, documentation, and registration) and training in storage and ammunition security (Physical Security and Stockpile Management, PSSM). The latter focuses on the safe storage and transport of ammunition and explosives, as well as on security precautions for ammunition depots, including their distances from civilian buildings. The various training courses last between a few days and several weeks. Approximately five to ten courses are conducted annually. Each course trains approximately 15&nbsp;to 60&nbsp;participants. The regional priorities are determined annually in consultation with the Federal Foreign Office. The current focus is on Southeast Europe, including Ukraine, West Africa, particularly the ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) region, and Central Asia.<br><br>In 2024, 182&nbsp;specialists were trained, including 33&nbsp;women and 149&nbsp;men. The politically defined goal is to train a total of at least 1,000&nbsp;people in this field between the beginning of 2024&nbsp;and the end of 2030. The required annual volume of training measures was reached in the first survey in 2024.<br><br>All trained individuals are considered equal in the indicator, regardless of the duration and intensity of the training, which somewhat limits its significance. Furthermore, no qualitative conclusions can be drawn from the indicator regarding the type of training or the subsequent practical application of the skills taught. Revision in the form of subsequent or ongoing monitoring of the content taught—if carried out—is not part of the indicator. Nor can it be determined to what extent or to what extent the trained individuals subsequently actually contribute to preventing the illegal proliferation of weapons.</p>'
