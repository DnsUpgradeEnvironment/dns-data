national_indicator_available: Organic farming        

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the share of total utilised agricultural area in Germany that is cultivated by organically managed farms subject to the control system regulated by the <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr> legislation on organic farming (Regulation (EC) No. 834/2007&nbsp;and the implementing rules). It includes land that has been fully converted to organic management as well as areas still undergoing conversion.        

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator represents the organically farmed area of agricultural holdings subject to the control procedure of <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr> legislation on organic farming (Regulation [EC] No. 848/2018&nbsp;and implementing provisions) as a proportion of the total farmed area in Germany (in per cent). This includes both areas that have been fully converted to organic farming and those that are still in the process of conversion.        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: The indicator is based on the assumption that organic farming conserves and protects natural resources to a particularly high degree. It has a variety of positive effects on nature, the climate and the environment and serves to produce high-quality food.        

political_target: Increase the proportion of organically farmed<br>agricultural land to 30&nbsp;per cent by 2030        

type_target: Goal with a specific target value        

data_state: 15.01.2025

content_and_progress: '<p><b style= "color: #dda63a; font-size: large">2.1.b Organic farming</b><br><br>Data on organic farming are provided both by the Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (<abbr title="Federal Office for Agriculture and Food" tabindex="0">BLE</abbr>), on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Rural Areas (BMLEH), and by the Federal Statistical Office.<br><br>To determine the amount of organically farmed land, the Federal Statistical Office employs various surveys. In years when a structural survey is conducted (such as the Agricultural Census or Agricultural Structure Survey), the data on organically farmed land are collected using primary statistical methods. In the intervening years, an estimation procedure is applied. In the future, data on organically farmed land are to be collected using secondary statistical methods as part of the land use survey for agricultural holdings&nbsp;–&nbsp;the successor to the previous main land use survey.<br><br>The reference value for calculating the proportion of organically farmed land is the utilised agricultural area, which is recorded annually by the Federal Statistical Office. This includes all areas used for agricultural or horticultural purposes. Buildings and farmyard areas belonging to agricultural holdings are not included in this reference value.<br><br>The <abbr title="Federal Office for Agriculture and Food" tabindex="0">BLE</abbr> data include information on organically farmed land reported annually by the organic regulatory authorities of the Länder. The reporting date is 31&nbsp;December of each year. All reports for the current year are accumulated up to this date. The <abbr title="Federal Office for Agriculture and Food" tabindex="0">BLE</abbr> data tend to show slightly higher values. Among other factors, this is because areas without a minimum size threshold are compared with the total area that includes such thresholds, and differing reporting periods are used. As a result, very small plots are included in the numerator when calculating the proportion, whereas only plots above a certain minimum size are considered in the denominator.<br><br>According to data from the Federal Statistical Office, the share of organically farmed land in the total utilised agricultural area increased from 2.9&nbsp;% in 1999&nbsp;to 11.2&nbsp;% in 2023. In 2023, this corresponded to an area of 1.85&nbsp;million hectares. The <abbr title="Federal Office for Agriculture and Food" tabindex="0">BLE</abbr> data show a slightly higher share of organic farming land, amounting to 11.4&nbsp;% or 1.89&nbsp;million hectares for 2023.<br><br>Based on figures from the Federal Statistical Office, if the trend observed over the past six reporting years were to continue, the share of organically farmed land would reach 16.7&nbsp;% by 2030. This means that the political target of achieving 30&nbsp;% organic farming by 2030&nbsp;would be missed, as would the previous federal government’s target of 20&nbsp;%.<br><br>In 2023, the organically farmed land in Germany was used as follows: 51.5&nbsp;% was permanent pasture, 47.0&nbsp;% was arable land, and 1.5&nbsp;% was classified as other land. In contrast, agriculture as a whole was predominantly focused on arable land, which made up 70.4&nbsp;% of the utilised agricultural area. The share of permanent pasture was 28.4&nbsp;%, and other land accounted for 1.2&nbsp;%.<br><br>According to the results of the 2023&nbsp;Agricultural Structure Survey, Saarland had the highest proportion of organically farmed land among the federal states, at 19.4&nbsp;%, followed by Brandenburg with 17.6&nbsp;% and Hessen with 15.4&nbsp;%. The extent to which organic farming is supported varies across the federal states.<br><br>According to <abbr title="European Statistical Office" tabindex="0">Eurostat</abbr> data, a total of 14.7&nbsp;million hectares were organically farmed in the <abbr title="European Union consisting of 27&nbsp;member states (without United Kingdom)" tabindex="0">EU-27</abbr>&nbsp;countries in 2020. This represented 9.1&nbsp;% of the total utilised agricultural area. In 2022, the highest shares of organic farmland in <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr> countries were recorded in Estonia (23.4&nbsp;%), followed by Sweden (19.9&nbsp;%), Portugal (19.3&nbsp;%), Italy (18.1&nbsp;%), Greece (17.2&nbsp;%), and the Czech Republic (16.0&nbsp;%).</p>'
