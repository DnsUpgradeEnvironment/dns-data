national_indicator_available: Mortality avoidable through prevention and treatment        

dns_indicator_definition: The indicators comprise deaths among women (3.1&nbsp;a) and men (3.1&nbsp;b) in the population below 70&nbsp;years of age with reference to 100,000&nbsp;inhabitants of the “old” standardised European population below 70&nbsp;years (excluding those less than 1&nbsp;year old).        

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator represents the avoidable deaths of the female and male population under the age of 75&nbsp;in relation to 100,000&nbsp;inhabitants of the 2013&nbsp;European standard population under the age of 75&nbsp;(excluding those under the age of 1). The indicator distinguishes between treatable and preventable mortality, the sum of which is the avoidable mortality.        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: Deaths are avoidable through prevention, early detection or optimal treatment. The indicator is therefore a measure of the quality of the healthcare system and the health behaviour of the population with regard to the extent to which deaths occur that could have been prevented in principle with appropriate prevention or treatment in a certain age group.        

political_target: Reduction to 200&nbsp;deaths per 100,000&nbsp;inhabitants by 2030        

type_target: Goal with a specific target value
