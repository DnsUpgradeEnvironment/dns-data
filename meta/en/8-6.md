national_indicator_available: Voluntary sustainability reporting by companies according to the German Sustainability Code (DNK)        

dns_indicator_definition:         

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator represents the number of sustainability reports voluntarily submitted by companies not subject to reporting requirements in accordance with the German Sustainability Code (DNK).        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: The indicator is intended to reflect the shift in the German corporate landscape towards a more intensive engagement with sustainability issues and to illustrate the increasing commitment of German companies to responsible business practices along global supply chains. The publication of corporate sustainability reports in accordance with standardised guidelines makes it easier to compare companies. It incentivises companies to enhance their reputation by improving their sustainability performance. The identification of economic opportunities and risks associated with climate change, biodiversity, labour conditions and human rights, among other things, can also help to make the company more sustainable and to further develop business models in a future-oriented manner.        

political_target: By 2030, the number of voluntary sustainability reports in accordance with the German Sustainability Code (DNK) will increase significantly

content_and_progress: '<p><b style= "color: #a21942; font-size: large">8.6&nbsp;Voluntary sustainability reporting by companies according to the German Sustainability Code (DNK)</b><br><br>The German Sustainability Code (DNK) was originally conceived as a standalone reporting standard, allowing companies to make their sustainable practices transparent and comparable with other companies. It was also intended to enable investment and purchasing decisions to be based on sustainability aspects. Developments at the European level have transformed the DNK into a support offering for the implementation of European reporting standards.<br><br>Since 2017, certain companies in Germany have been legally required to prepare sustainability reports. This obligation stems from the European CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) Directive and its national implementation, the CSR Directive Implementation Act (CSR-RUG). The directive sets out both formal and substantive requirements and defines which companies are required to report. As part of the "European Green Deal," the directive was reformed in 2022&nbsp;(since renamed the "Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive" (CSRD), which was intended to gradually expand the scope of the reporting obligation and the number of companies affected starting in 2025. The extent to which the planned expansion of mandatory sustainability reporting will be revised and, if necessary, weakened is currently being discussed by the European institutions. On February 26, 2025, the European Commission presented the so-called Omnibus Sustainability Package, which, among other things, provides for a limitation of the scope of the CSRD.<br><br>At the same time, the European Commission announced that it will present its own standard for voluntary sustainability reporting by companies, the "Voluntary SME Standard (VSME)," in the course of 2025. This standard is intended to target companies that are not themselves required to report under the CSRD but must comply with information requirements from contractual partners in the value chain or the capital market.<br><br>The indicator on voluntary sustainability reporting records the number of companies that are not (yet) required to report under the CSRD but have submitted sustainability reports to the German Sustainability Code. Limiting the reporting to the German Sustainability Code ensures transparent data availability and avoids the mixing or double counting of reporting standards. On the other hand, the informative value of the indicator may be limited by the fact that only one of several possible standards is considered, even though others may serve a similar function. It should also be noted that the number of submitted Sustainability Code declarations does not allow for direct conclusions about the actual extent of sustainable business practices in companies in Germany, but merely reflects the quantitative scope of sustainability reporting according to the Sustainability Code.<br><br>Large companies with corresponding reporting requirements are not included. The voluntarily submitted reports of the remaining companies are included in the indicator without weighting, regardless of size, economic sector, or potential impact of their sustainability activities.<br><br>A total of 462&nbsp;companies submitted reports in 2023. Compared to previous years, the indicator shows no clear trend: 532&nbsp;reports were recorded in 2022, compared to only 407&nbsp;in 2021. It should also be noted that some of the submitted reports do not contain any information on whether the companies in question are already subject to reporting requirements. In 2023, this affected 43&nbsp;reports, which may also have come from companies that report voluntarily. The majority of reports in 2023&nbsp;were submitted by smaller companies. 256&nbsp;reports, representing more than half of the indicator value, came from companies with fewer than 250&nbsp;employees. In addition, 69&nbsp;reports were submitted by companies with 250&nbsp;to 499&nbsp;employees, and 102&nbsp;reports were submitted by companies with 500&nbsp;to 4,999&nbsp;employees.<br><br><br><br>A potential expansion of the reporting requirement under the CSRD is likely to have far-reaching effects on the number of companiesthat voluntarily prepare sustainability reports. On the one hand, larger companies that are required to report will also be expected to request sustainability information from their suppliers. This could lead to smaller companies in the value chains also being encouraged to report on sustainability, even though they are not officially affected by the expansion of the reporting requirement. On the other hand, companies that have previously reported voluntarily on the DNK will be excluded from the indicator count as soon as they are directly affected by the expansion of the reporting obligation and consequently no longer report voluntarily.</p>'
