The latter includes 17- and 18-year-olds who attend a grammar school (Gymnasium) or vocational school leading to higher education entrance qualifications (Hochschulreife) or a university of applied sciences entrance qualification.<br><br>The indicator distinguishes between 17- and 18-year-olds who, due to their social background, are exposed to a so-called risk situation and those who are not. These risk situations include "social risk" when neither parent is employed; "formally low-skilled parents" when neither parent has completed vocational training or higher education entrance qualifications; and "financial risk" when the household"s net equivalent income is below the poverty line. These risk situations are often interdependent and therefore often occur together. Therefore, many young people are exposed to several risk situations simultaneously. 4% of those under 18&nbsp;were exposed to all three risk situations simultaneously, while 30.9% were affected by at least one of the three.<br><br>The data is based on the Federal Statistical Office"s microcensus, an annual sample survey covering 1% of the German population. Due to a comprehensive redesign of the microcensus in 2020, the data collected from this year onwards are only partially comparable with those of previous years. The results for 2023&nbsp;are based on preliminary data from the initial results of the microcensus.<br><br><b>Development and Methodological Limitations</b><br><br>In 2023, 58.6% of 17- and 18-year-olds were seeking or already had a university entrance qualification. Among 17- and 18-year-olds with one or more risk situations, this proportion was significantly lower at 43.7%. Among 17- and 18-year-olds without a risk situation, the proportion was 65.0%.<br><br>In addition to Gymnasium (grammar school) and vocational schools, higher education entrance qualifications can also be obtained at other types of schools, such as community schools. However, since these types of schools predominantly lead to a Realschule (Real- or Hauptschule) qualification, 17- and 18-year-olds who are pursuing higher education entrance qualifications at, for example, a community school are not included. In this respect, the indicator underestimates the actual situation.<br><br>In addition to 17- and 18-year-olds who already have a higher education entrance qualification, the indicator only includes those 17- and 18-year-olds who attend a school type primarily aimed at obtaining such a qualification. The actual graduation rates, which are sometimes significantly lower, are not included in the indicator. Therefore, the number of university entrance qualifications sought in the indicator does not correspond to the number of university entrance qualifications actually acquired later. The fact that the university entrance qualifications actually acquired are not taken into account is primarily for methodological reasons: Many students only obtain the higher education entrance qualification after the age of 18. However, only about 84% of 19-year-olds live with at least one parent in the same household, meaning that no information is available for determining the risk status of the remaining 16%.<br><br>A further limitation of the indicator"s validity is that approximately 15% of 17-year-olds and 7% of 18-year-olds are still attending lower secondary education (grades up to 9/10). In such cases, it is sometimes not clear whether these young adults are pursuing an educational program aimed at obtaining a higher education entrance qualification or not.<br><br>In 2023, the difference between the proportions of 17- and 18-year-olds with and without a risk status who are seeking or already hold a higher education entrance qualification was 21.3&nbsp;percentage points. There is no clear trend in recent years, and therefore an estimate of the target"s attainability is not possible.</p>'
