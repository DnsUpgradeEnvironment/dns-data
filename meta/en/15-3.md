In addition to impacts on biodiversity, the microclimate, and soil fauna, sealed surfaces prevent precipitation water from seeping into the ground, which can contribute to a drop in the groundwater level and overload the drainage system during heavy rainfall events.<br><br>An area is considered sealed if it is built on, covered with concrete, asphalt, paved, or otherwise permanently impermeable to water. Sealed surfaces are found primarily in residential areas, on traffic areas, and in industrial and commercial areas. Sealed parts of areas such as allotments, cemeteries, sports and recreation areas, or campsites are also included.<br><br>Unsealed areas include, among others, construction sites (provided there is no visible development), mines, quarries, peat extraction areas, sand pits, as well as natural, artificial, and cultivated vegetated areas, unplanted or sparsely vegetated areas, agricultural fields and arable land, vineyards, orchards, and all types of lawns used for sports, as well as forests. Glacier, snow, and water surfaces are also considered unsealed areas.<br><br>The indicator is calculated based on data from the European Copernicus program. Satellite data is automatically evaluated to create the dataset, with the proportion of sealed area determined for each area cell under consideration and then the average value calculated for Germany as a whole. The dataset is based exclusively on information derived from remote sensing of the Earth"s surface. Information from cadastral records or similar sources is not included in the dataset.<br><br>This approach can lead to inaccuracies, as sealed areas may not be identified as such, for example, if they are located under a closed canopy. The opposite effect occurs with ground-mounted photovoltaic systems (solar parks), which are recorded as sealed areas even though they are generally built on unsealed soil. Railway ballast areas cannot be clearly classified methodically. Within urban areas, these areas cannot be clearly distinguished from other infrastructure areas based on remote sensing data and are therefore classified as sealed areas, whereas outside urban areas they are considered unsealed areas.<br><br>The indicator represents only the proportion of sealed areas. It does not take into account the extent to which the unsealed area has the desired properties regarding water permeability. Thus, areas that are naturally almost impermeable to water, such as rocky, loamy, and clay soils, are counted as unsealed areas. This also applies to agricultural land, which can be heavily compacted, at least temporarily, due to intensive machine traffic.<br><br>In 2006&nbsp;and 2009, the degree of sealing was 4.2% of Germany"s total area and increased only marginally to 4.3% by 2015. In 2018, the degree of soil sealing was 5.2%. However, this increase is less the result of an actual increase. Rather, the analysis from 2018&nbsp;onwards is based on significantly higher-resolution satellite images, which allows for a more spatially detailed and realistic assessment of soil sealing.<br><br>Particularly in residential areas, soil sealing not only has a significant impact on the provision potential, but also on the direct demand for various ecosystem services such as local cooling. Therefore, in the <a href="https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Umwelt/UGR/oekosystemgesamtrechnungen/_inhalt.html">Ecosystem Accounts</a>, the Federal Statistical Office calculates soil sealing separately for residential areas and transport infrastructure areas (Ecosystem Department A01&nbsp;of the Area Balance of Ecosystems). In 2018, the degree of soil sealing on these areas was 42.5%.<br><br>Due to the significantly higher spatial resolution of the satellite data from 2018&nbsp;onwards, a meaningful interpretation over time using previous results is not possible. Therefore, the politically defined goal of reducing the increase in soil sealing cannot yet be assessed.</p>'

data_footnotes: <br>Die Daten basieren auf einer Sonderauswertung und sind nicht öffentlich zugänglich.<br>• Seit dem Berichtsjahr 2018&nbsp;liegen Daten in einer höheren Auflösung vor, so dass die Bodenversiegelung ab 2018&nbsp;räumlich detaillierter und realistischer abgebildet wird. Dadurch ist eine Vergleichbarkeit mit den Vorjahren nur eingeschränkt möglich (Zeitreihenbruch).
