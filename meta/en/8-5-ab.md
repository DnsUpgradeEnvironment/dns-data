national_indicator_available: Employment rate        

dns_indicator_definition: The indicators specify the proportion of persons in employment aged between 20&nbsp;and 64&nbsp;years (8.5.a) and aged between 60&nbsp;and 64&nbsp;years (8.5.b), measured in each case as a share of the total population of the same age group.        

dns_indicator_definition_new: The employment rate for indicator 8.5.a represents the proportion of employed persons aged 20&nbsp;to 64&nbsp;(total) and for indicator 8.5.b the proportion of employed persons aged 55&nbsp;to 64&nbsp;(older persons) among all persons in the same age group (in per cent).        

dns_indicator_intention: Due to demographic changes, there could be a shortage of professionals in Germany in the long run. At the same time, the social security system is threatened by an increasing shortage of funds. The available labour force potential must therefore be more effectively utilised in the future. The employment rate, that is, the share of persons in employment in the working-age population (20&nbsp;to 64&nbsp;years of age) should be increased to 78&nbsp;% by 2030. In addition, the goal of the Federal Government is to achieve an employment rate of 60&nbsp;% among older people (60&nbsp;to 64&nbsp;years of age) by 2030.        

dns_political_intention: Demographic change may lead to a shortage of skilled labour in Germany in the long term. At the same time, there is a threat of increasing underfunding of the social security systems. The available labour force potential must therefore be better utilised in the future.

It covers the population living in private households, but does not include people living in collective accommodation. The economically active population covered by the labour force survey consists of persons aged 15&nbsp;and over who performed an activity for remuneration for at least one hour during the reference week or who worked as unpaid family workers. Also included are persons who temporarily did not work because they were absent, for example due to holidays or illness. It should be noted that there have been changes over time in the Labor Force Survey that affect the comparability of the time series presented over time (<abbr title="for example (exempli gratia)" tabindex="0">e.g.</abbr> adjustment to results of the 2011&nbsp;census, revision of the 2020&nbsp;Microcensus).<br><br>The total employment rate (20&nbsp;to 64-year-olds) rose by 10.9&nbsp;percentage points from 68.7&nbsp;% in 2000&nbsp;to 79.6&nbsp;% in 2021. Thus, the target value of 78.0&nbsp;% for 2030&nbsp;has already been achieved from 2015&nbsp;on. The employment rate among older people (60&nbsp;to 64-year-olds) rose by 41.5&nbsp;percentage points from 19.6&nbsp;% in 2000&nbsp;to 61.1&nbsp;% in 2021. The employment rate for men in that age group had more than doubled, rising by 38.5&nbsp;percentage points to 65.7&nbsp;%. The rate for women even increased almost fivefold from 12.1&nbsp;% to 56.7&nbsp;%. Hence, the targeted 60&nbsp;% employment rate for older people was likewise reached since 2018&nbsp;ahead of the deadline set in the German strategy for sustainable development.<br><br>The overall employment rates for women and men have developed in the same direction since 2000&nbsp;but at different rates. The rate for 20&nbsp;to 64-year-old men rose in the period under review by 6.7&nbsp;percentage points to 83.2&nbsp;%, whereas in the case of women it rose by 15.2&nbsp;percentage points to 75.9&nbsp;%, which was a far more rapid rise, albeit from a lower starting point. When assessing the increase in the employment rate for women, it should be taken into account that this growth was accompanied by an increase in part-time employment. In the year 2000, 61.5&nbsp;% of employed women worked full-time, while 38.5&nbsp;% worked part-time. In 2021, 52.3&nbsp;% and 47.7&nbsp;% of employed women worked full-time and part-time, respectively. By way of comparison, the proportion of the male workforce in full-time employment dropped from 95.7&nbsp;% in 2000&nbsp;to 89.8&nbsp;% in 2021.<br><br>A breakdown into age groups shows diverse employment rate trends. Among 20&nbsp;to 24-year-olds, the rate rose from 2000&nbsp;to 2021&nbsp;by 2.4&nbsp;percentage points to 67.2&nbsp;%. Among 25- to 59-year-olds, by contrast, the employment rate rose to 83.9&nbsp;%, an increase of 7.7&nbsp;percentage points. The lower employment rates of 20&nbsp;to 24&nbsp;year-olds is also related to the average duration of education at school and university, which postpones entry into working life.</p>'

target_description: By 2030, the overall employment rate (8.5.a) is to be increased to at least 83&nbsp;per cent and the employment rate of older people (8.5.b) to at least 77&nbsp;per cent.<br><br><br>Based on the target formulation, indicator 8.5.a for the year 2024&nbsp;is rated as "Cloud".
