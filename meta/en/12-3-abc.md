national_indicator_available: Sustainable procurement        

dns_indicator_definition: These indicators show sustainability in procurement through the examples of paper and the <abbr title="Carbon dioxide" tabindex="0">CO₂</abbr> emissions of motor vehicles. Each is depicted as an index using 2015&nbsp;as its base year.<br>Indicator 12.3.a ”Paper bearing the Blue Angel label as a proportion of the total paper consumption of the direct federal administration” measures what proportion of total paper procured for the direct federal administration is certified with the Blue Angel ecolabel. Since reporting year 2018, only non-coloured A4-sized printer and copier paper is recorded.<br>Indicator 12.3.b “CO₂ emissions of publicity owned vehicles by distance travelled” shows the <abbr title="Carbon dioxide" tabindex="0">CO₂</abbr> emissions of publicly owned vehicles in relation to the distances they travel.        

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicators illustrate sustainability in public procurement using examples of award procedures overall (12.3.a), <abbr title="Carbon dioxide" tabindex="0">CO₂</abbr> emissions from motor vehicles (12.3.b) and sustainable textile procurement (12.3.c). The indicator 12.3.a ‘Award procedures in public procurement in which at least one sustainability criterion was taken into account’ represents the proportion of the total number of procedures for awarding public contracts/concessions with consideration of sustainability criteria that were reported to the procurement statistics for the respective reporting year (in per cent). Indicator 12.3.b ‘CO₂ emissions per kilometres travelled by public sector vehicles’ compares <abbr title="Carbon dioxide" tabindex="0">CO₂</abbr> emissions with the base year 2015&nbsp;in relation to the corresponding kilometres travelled. Indicator 12.3.c shows the sustainable textile procurement of the Federal Administration (excluding special textiles) (in per cent).        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: The public sector has a significant share in the demand for products and services. Aligning public procurement with the guiding principle of sustainability and strengthening sustainability criteria in public procurement should therefore act as a lever for increasing the supply of sustainable products.        

political_target: "12.3.a: Significantly increase the proportion of public procurement contracts in which sustainability criteria are taken into account so that this is the norm by 2030. It should be noted that procurement to cover the needs of the German Federal Armed Forces, the Federal Police and civil defence and disaster control will not contribute to an increase.<br>12.3.b: Significant reduction<br>12.3.c: Increase to 50&nbsp;per cent by 2026"        

type_target: "12.3.a: Target direction<br>12.3.b: Target direction<br>12.3.c: Goal with a specific target value"
