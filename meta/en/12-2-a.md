dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the number of locations in Germany registered with <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr>, the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme, for German as well as foreign organisations.        

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator represents the number of sites in Germany registered for the <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme) environmental management system by both German and foreign organisations.        

dns_indicator_intention: Climate change, the energy transition and scarcity of resources are presenting companies with new challenges that are forcing them to reconfigure their business processes, structures and products along environmentally responsible and resource-saving lines. <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> offers a strategy for organisations to pursue systematic environmental protection, with the ultimate aim of steadily improving their locations’ environmental performance. The goal is therefore to identify a total of 5,000&nbsp;organisation premises for registration with <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> by 2030.        

dns_political_intention: Climate change, the energy transition and the scarcity of resources are presenting companies with new challenges, with the result that they must organise their business processes, structures and products in a way that protects the environment and conserves resources. The <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme) environmental management system offers a concept for systematic operational environmental protection and is linked to the aim of continuously improving the environmental performance of the organisation's location.

Having <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> certification does not automatically mean that organisations or their products are more environmentally friendly than comparable organisations and products. <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> involves a reporting obligation requiring organisations to submit environmental statements. These statements include reporting on the main environmental impacts of the organisation in question as well as data pertaining to energy and material efficiency, emissions, water, waste and use of land/biodiversity. Organisations have to update their environmental statements annually, with the exception introduced in 2010&nbsp;that small and medium-sized enterprises can apply to do so every two years instead. The environmental statement, which is public, and various additional internal documents are inspected by independent, licensed environmental verifiers. The verification must be repeated on a regular basis, no less than every three years. Organisations that pass the verification process and have no breaches of environmental regulations or complaints to answer for are added to the <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> register. The German <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> Advisory Board<sup>1</sup> is responsible for quality assurance. <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> organisations and locations are registered by the responsible chambers of industry and commerce and stored in a publicly accessible database at the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry.<br><br>In terms of methodology, it should be noted that the <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> register shows the number of registrations. Participating organisations are free to include several locations under a single organisation registration (corporate registration) or to have their locations registered individually. Some organisations have had their sites abroad registered in Germany. These are present in the <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> register, but they are not included in the number of <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> locations recorded here.<br><br>In 2021, there were 2,290&nbsp;<abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> locations registered in Germany. This equates to an increase of 17&nbsp;% compared with 2005. Considered over the last five years, the indicator has been gradually moving in the direction of the target. Nevertheless, if that trend continues unchanged, the goal for 2030&nbsp;will not be achieved.<br><br>The registered organisations employed a total of 911,042&nbsp;people in 2021. This equates to an decline of 5.2&nbsp;% compared with 2005.<br><br>The 2,290&nbsp;<abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> locations on the register in 2021&nbsp;belong to 1,115&nbsp;German organisations. The number of German organisations had shrunk by 25.2&nbsp;% since 2005. Furthermore, those organisations were very well spread throughout the country. The majority were based in Baden-Württemberg (330) and Bavaria (296), followed by North Rhine-Westphalia (99). In contrast, there was just one registered organisation in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Divided by sector, the distribution was as follows: 39.4&nbsp;% of the German organisations represented the manufacturing industry, 8.2&nbsp;% miscellaneous services, 8.0&nbsp;% the education sector, 6.2&nbsp;% areas of water supply, waste water and waste disposal and removal of environmental pollution as well as 6.1&nbsp;% the hospitality industry. It should be noted that some of the organisations belong to more than one sector.<br><br><small><sup>1</sup>The <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> Advisory Board is an independent advisory body of the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection.</small></p>'
