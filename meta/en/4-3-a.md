dns_indicator_definition:         

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator represents the proportion of the population aged 25&nbsp;to 64&nbsp;(in per cent) who have participated in formal or non-formal education or training in the 12&nbsp;months prior to the survey. Formal education and training is defined as education provided through the system of schools, colleges, universities and other formal educational institutions. Non-formal education and training includes all organised and sustained learning activities that are not part of formal education.        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: Continuing education is important in view of the changes in the economy, the labour market and society. With its National Continuing Education Strategy, the German government has already set itself the goal of attracting more employees and companies to continuing education and training in 2022.        

political_target: Increase to 65&nbsp;per cent by 2030        

type_target: Goal with a specific target value

content_and_progress: '<p><b style= "color: #c5192d; font-size: large">4.3.a Participation in continuing education</b><br><br>The indicator measures the proportion of the population aged 25&nbsp;to 64&nbsp;who participated in formal or non-formal education or training in the twelve months prior to the survey. Formal education encompasses educational activities at schools, colleges, and universities that follow a defined curriculum, culminate in a qualification recognized within the national qualifications framework, such as a high school diploma, bachelor"s degree, or master"s degree, and last at least six months. Non-formal continuing education refers to organized learning activities outside the formal education system, such as vocational training, workshops, or online courses, that impart specific skills or knowledge and do not lead to a formal qualification.<br><br>The data for this indicator come from the Adult Education Survey (AES), a Europe-wide coordinated survey that maps the continuing education behavior of the adult population. It records the extent to which adults participate in formal or non-formal education, the types of continuing education activities they pursue, and their reasons for or against participating in continuing education. The survey is mandatory for all member states of the European Union (<abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr>) and is conducted every six years. In the interim years, national surveys will be conducted in Germany, which will be conducted every three years starting in 2025&nbsp;(previously every two years).<br><br>Since the first survey in 2007, the proportion of 25- to 64-year-olds in continuing education has risen continuously from 45% to 62% in 2020. The continuing education participation rates for women and men in this age group have been almost equal since 2016. The last survey in 2022&nbsp;showed a slight decline to 60%, possibly related to the <abbr title="Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2" tabindex="0">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic and the associated restrictions, such as the lack of face-to-face teaching. A similar decline has also been observed in other continuing education surveys. In an <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr>-wide comparison, Germany is thus significantly above the <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr>-wide continuing education participation rate of 46.6%.<br><br>Non-formal education or training accounted for by far the largest share of the indicator value. In 2022, 57.8% of respondents reported participating in such measures, while only 7.4% were in formal education. This total exceeds the indicator value, as 5.2% of respondents participated in non-formal education in addition to formal education.<br><br>Among the non-formal education measures taken, the subject area "Business, Administration, and Law" was the most represented at 25.4%, followed by "Services" at 18.9%, "Health and Social Services" at 14.3%, and "Information and Communication Technologies" at 14.0%.<br><br>An analysis of the survey results by age group shows that participation in continuing education declines significantly with increasing age. While 70.5% of 25- to 34-year-olds participate in continuing education measures, this only applies to 61.8% of 35- to 44-year-olds, 60.1% of 45- to 54-year-olds, and 51.5% of 55- to 64-year-olds.<br><br>The indicator does not evaluate continuing education measures. For example, master"s degree programs are taken into account, as are one-off, short workshops attended purely for personal interest. The indicator therefore provides a good overall impression of the quantitative extent of training and continuing education, but does not allow conclusions to be drawn about the timing and quality of the measures taken.<br><br>Despite the decline, the average development in recent years shows a positive trend, so that the politically set target of 65% participation in continuing education could possibly be achieved as early as 2027, provided the average development of recent years continues.</p>'

target_description: Participation in continuing education should increase to at least 65&nbsp;per cent by 2030.<br><br>Based on the target formulation, the average development of the last six years (despite a slight deterioration in 2022) shows an increase that, if maintained, would mean that the politically defined target would already be achieved in 2027. Indicator 4.3.a is rated "Sun" for the year 2022.
