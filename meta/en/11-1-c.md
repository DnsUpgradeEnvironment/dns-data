data_footnotes: The changeover from the old to the new catalogue of types of use was completed in 2016. Due to the effects on the official area statistics, the 2016&nbsp;result is only comparable with previous years to a limited extent. To ensure comparability between the years, the respective values were calculated back from the 2011&nbsp;census and the change in the area survey in 2016.<br>• The data is based on a special evaluation and is not publicly available.
