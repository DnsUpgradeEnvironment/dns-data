dns_indicator_intention: Parental allowance is intended to assist mothers and fathers in sharing their tasks in a spirit of partnership and in successfully reconciling work and family life. The introduction of parental allowance plus (ElterngeldPlus) and the partnership bonus (Partnerschaftsbonus) in particular are intended to keep driving social change in the stereotypical role models for mothers and fathers and ultimately to promote equality of opportunity in the labour market. For that reason, the German Federal Government has set itself the target of increasing the proportion of fathers receiving parental allowance to 65&nbsp;% by 2030.        

dns_political_intention: Parental allowance is intended to support families in sharing responsibilities as partners and to achieve a good work-life balance for mothers and fathers. The introduction of Parental Allowance Plus and the partnership bonus in particular is intended to further promote social change in gender-stereotypical role models of mothers and fathers and ultimately promote equality in the labour market.

target_description: The proportion of children whose fathers have received parental allowance should increase to at least 65&nbsp;per cent by 2030.<br><br><br>Based on the target formulation, the value of indicator 5.1.d would only increase to around 59.5&nbsp;per cent by 2030&nbsp;if the average development of the years 2016&nbsp;to 2021&nbsp;continues. The difference to the politically defined target value would be so great (over 20&nbsp;per cent of the difference between the target value and the value from 2021) that it is unlikely that the target will be achieved. Indicator 5.1.d is rated as "cloud" for 2021.
