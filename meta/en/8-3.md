national_indicator_available: Gross fixed capital formation in relation to GDP        

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the share of gross fixed capital formation relative to nominal gross domestic product (which means at current prices). This share is also referred to as the investment ratio. The level of gross fixed capital formation includes additions (that is, acquisitions less disposals without taking into account consumption of fixed capital) of fixed assets by resident economic units. Fixed assets are produced assets that are designed for repeated or continuous use in production processes for longer than a year. These include buildings and structures (dwellings, other buildings and structures), equipment (machinery, vehicles, tools including weapons systems) and other assets (intellectual property such as investments in research and development, computer software and databases, entertainment, literary or artistic originals, mineral exploration and evaluation as well as animal resources and tree, crop and plant resources). Also included are improvements on existing stocks of fixed assets that lead to a significant increase in the value of an asset and/or prolong its useful life.        

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator represents the share of gross fixed capital formation in nominal gross domestic product (<abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>), <abbr title="that is to say (id est)" tabindex="0">i.e.</abbr> in current prices (in per cent). This share is also referred to as the investment ratio. Gross fixed capital formation comprises the acquisition (<abbr title="that is to say (id est)" tabindex="0">i.e.</abbr> acquisitions less disposals, excluding depreciation) of fixed assets by resident economic units. Fixed assets are produced assets that are intended to be used repeatedly or continuously in the production process for more than one year. These include buildings (residential, non-residential), equipment (machinery, vehicles, equipment including military weapon systems) and other assets (livestock and crops as well as intellectual property such as investments in research and development, software and databases, copyrights and exploratory drilling). Significant improvements to existing fixed assets are also included.        

dns_indicator_intention: The future strength and competitiveness of an economy depend crucially on corporate and governmental investments. For this reason, the target of the Federal Government is to promote appropriate development of the ratio of gross fixed capital formation to gross domestic product (<abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>).        

dns_political_intention: The future economic performance and competitiveness of an economy depend crucially on the investments made by companies and the state.        

political_target: Appropriate development of the share; maintenance until 2030

National accounts are compiled in accordance with harmonised international rules and standards, that is, the European System of Accounts (<abbr title="European System of Accounts" tabindex="0">ESVG</abbr>), and are based on all available, relevant data sources.<br><br>In 2021, the ratio of gross fixed capital formation to <abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr> was at 21.8&nbsp;% for the entire federal territory, price adjusted at 21.0&nbsp;%. The indicator has moved into the desired direction both in the short and medium term. Since 2015, the quota slightly increased (20.0&nbsp;%). The lack of a definition for appropriate development causes a positive appearance when considering the last six data points. In comparison, the investment ratio was 3.1&nbsp;percentage points below the initial value in 1991&nbsp;as well as 1.4&nbsp;percentage points lower than in 2000. After price adjustments, the share of gross fixed capital formation relative to <abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr> is 1.1&nbsp;percentage points below the value in 1991. Since 1996, the average investment ratio in Germany is lower than the investment ratio for the entire <abbr title="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development" tabindex="0">OECD</abbr> region (2020: 22.2&nbsp;%). While the difference between 2001&nbsp;and 2010&nbsp;was –2.4&nbsp;percentage points on average, latter decreased in the period from 2011&nbsp;to 2020&nbsp;to –1.0. In the years from 2015&nbsp;to 2021, gross fixed capital formation soared by a total of 29.4&nbsp;%, reaching 783.8&nbsp;billion euros. Since the increase in nominal <abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr> was somewhat lower, at 19.0&nbsp;%, the investment ratio increased slightly from 20.0&nbsp;% to 21.8&nbsp;%. With regard to investments in building projects, housing construction has recorded strong nominal growth (+&nbsp;92.6&nbsp;%) since 2010, while the growth of investments in non-residential construction, including civil engineering, in the same period was less pronounced (52.7&nbsp;%) and even dipped slightly in 2012&nbsp;and 2015. Equipment investments increased by 28.0&nbsp;%. The strongest growth since 1991&nbsp;was recorded for investments in research and development as well as in computer software and databases. Its volume almost tripled.<br><br>The period from 1991&nbsp;to 2021&nbsp;witnessed a strong shift in investment activity from industry to the service sector. In 1991, 30.4&nbsp;% of new fixed capital formation was still being made by enterprises of the industry sector. By 2021, this figure had fallen to just 22.4&nbsp;%. In 2021, 76.3&nbsp;% of fixed capital formation was made in the service branches. In 1991, this figure was still 67.9&nbsp;%. The largest single investment area was that of real estate activities. In 2021&nbsp;alone, this sector accounted for 33.1&nbsp;% of all new fixed assets. The general government sector, whose investment activities are spread across various sectors of the economy, accounted for 12.4&nbsp;% of gross fixed capital formation in 2020&nbsp;and 11.9&nbsp;% in 2021.<br><br>Most recent data for the German Länder in 2019&nbsp;reveals, that the highest investment ratio was measured for Lower Saxony at 27.6&nbsp;% and the lowest investment ratios were measured for Bremen and North Rhine-Westphalia at 15.7&nbsp;% and 16.4&nbsp;%, respectively.</p>'
