national_indicator_available: Gross fixed capital formation in relation to GDP        

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the share of gross fixed capital formation relative to nominal gross domestic product (which means at current prices). This share is also referred to as the investment ratio. The level of gross fixed capital formation includes additions (that is, acquisitions less disposals without taking into account consumption of fixed capital) of fixed assets by resident economic units. Fixed assets are produced assets that are designed for repeated or continuous use in production processes for longer than a year. These include buildings and structures (dwellings, other buildings and structures), equipment (machinery, vehicles, tools including weapons systems) and other assets (intellectual property such as investments in research and development, computer software and databases, entertainment, literary or artistic originals, mineral exploration and evaluation as well as animal resources and tree, crop and plant resources). Also included are improvements on existing stocks of fixed assets that lead to a significant increase in the value of an asset and/or prolong its useful life.        

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator represents the share of gross fixed capital formation in nominal gross domestic product (<abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>), <abbr title="that is to say (id est)" tabindex="0">i.e.</abbr> in current prices (in per cent). This share is also referred to as the investment ratio. Gross fixed capital formation comprises the acquisition (<abbr title="that is to say (id est)" tabindex="0">i.e.</abbr> acquisitions less disposals, excluding depreciation) of fixed assets by resident economic units. Fixed assets are produced assets that are intended to be used repeatedly or continuously in the production process for more than one year. These include buildings (residential, non-residential), equipment (machinery, vehicles, equipment including military weapon systems) and other assets (livestock and crops as well as intellectual property such as investments in research and development, software and databases, copyrights and exploratory drilling). Significant improvements to existing fixed assets are also included.        

dns_indicator_intention: The future strength and competitiveness of an economy depend crucially on corporate and governmental investments. For this reason, the target of the Federal Government is to promote appropriate development of the ratio of gross fixed capital formation to gross domestic product (<abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>).        

dns_political_intention: The future economic performance and competitiveness of an economy depend crucially on the investments made by companies and the state.

target_description: The target allows for various interpretations. For the assessment of the indicator carried out here, it is assumed that the ratio of gross fixed capital formation to gross domestic product should increase.<br><br><br>Based on the formulation of the target, it is not relevant for the assessment of the indicator whether the increase is achieved by an increase in the numerator or a reduction in the denominator. The values of indicator 8.3&nbsp;fell both in 2024&nbsp;and on average between 2019&nbsp;and 2024, <abbr title="that is to say (id est)" tabindex="0">i.e.</abbr> the values did not develop in the desired direction. Indicator 8.3&nbsp;is rated as "Thunderstorm" for the year 2024.
