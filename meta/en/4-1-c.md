dns_indicator_definition:         

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator represents the proportion of general education and vocational schools (in per cent) that have at least one certification in the area of Education for Sustainable Development (from a set of ESD labels defined by the Länder Ministries of Education and Cultural Affairs). The ESD labels are intended to characterise a school's special commitment to anchoring Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in lessons and school development.        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: The concept of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) aims to enable pupils to actively shape an ecologically compatible, economically efficient and socially just environment, taking into account global aspects, basic democratic principles and cultural diversity.        

political_target: Continuous increase

The indicator "Schools with ESD Label," introduced by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the States (KMK), records the proportion of schools awarded specific ESD labels.<br><br>The first survey of this indicator took place between July and November 2024. It considered 27&nbsp;different ESD labels, seven of which are awarded nationwide and 20&nbsp;only in individual federal states. The labels are selected according to established criteria intended to reflect the integration of ESD in school and teaching development.<br><br>The results of the survey for the 2023/2024&nbsp;school year show that 3,556&nbsp;of a total of 29,988&nbsp;public and private general and vocational schools in Germany have been awarded ESD labels, corresponding to approximately 11.9% of schools. Schools with multiple ESD certificates are counted only once as an ESD-certified school. The next survey is planned for the 2025/2026&nbsp;school year.<br><br>The criteria for consideration and pre-selection of ESD labels were developed by a working group consisting of representatives from the federal and state governments, as well as from academia. To be recognized as an ESD label, the labels must meet requirements designed to ensure that the integration of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in teaching goes beyond the basic requirements of the curriculum and is considered as a component of overall school development within a holistic approach (Whole School Approach).<br><br>The nationally recognized ESD labels include the Club of Rome Schools Label, Fairtrade Schools, the Nature Park School, Schools for Earth, the Environmental School in Europe&nbsp;–&nbsp;International Sustainability School, the UNESCO Project Schools, and the Consumer Schools (Gold) Label.<br><br>Despite the established selection criteria, changes in the labels considered, both in terms of their content requirements and the quantitative scope of the overall labels considered, will influence the significance of the indicator over time.<br><br>The qualitative significance of the indicator is limited due to the heterogeneous structure of the label system, as the various labels have different award criteria and thus no uniform level of ESD integration can be guaranteed. Furthermore, the indicator does not provide direct information about the success of education for sustainable development or the knowledge actually imparted. Therefore, the mere number of award-winning schools does not directly reflect the quality of ESD implementation. This indicator also does not provide any information about the proportion of students at ESD-certified schools.<br><br>The politically defined goal of increasing the proportion of schools with the ESD (Education for Sustainable Development) label cannot currently be assessed because no data are yet available over time.</p>'
