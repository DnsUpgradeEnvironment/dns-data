national_indicator_available: Share of electricity from renewable sources in gross electricity consumption    

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator reflects the share of electricity from renewable energy sources in gross electricity consumption.    

dns_indicator_intention: Switching to renewables, natural energy sources that constantly regenerate, can reduce demand for fossil fuels. As a result, dependence on imports of conventional fuels would be reduced, as would the release of energy-related emissions, which would limit the extent of climate change. The German Government had therefore set itself the aim of increasing the share of electricity from renewable sources in gross electricity consumption to at least 35% by 2020&nbsp;and at least 65% by 2030.<br>Before 2050, all electricity generated and consumed in Germany is to be greenhouse gas neutral.    

data_state: The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of 31.10.2022. The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href="https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/publications/reports/en/2022.pdf">indicator report 2022</a>.

#content     
content_and_progress: '<i>Text from the <a href="https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/publications/reports/en/2022.pdf">Indicator Report 2022&nbsp;</a></i><br><br>The indicator is calculated by the Working Group on Renewable Energy Statistics (<abbr title="Working Group on Renewable Energy Statistics">AGEE-Stat</abbr>) from various official and unofficial sources. Gross electricity consumption is the sum of all generated and imported electricity minus the volume of exported electricity. It therefore comprises the electricity generated in Germany, the balance of exchanges across national borders, power stations’ own electricity consumption and network losses. The following are considered to be renewable energies: wind power, hydro power, solar radiation energy, geothermal energy and biomass including biogas, biomethane, landfill gas and sludge gas as well as the biodegradable proportion of waste from households and industry.<br><br>Over the period from 2005&nbsp;to 2019, the share of renewable energies in electricity consumption increased from 10.3% to 42.0%. This means that the target set by the German Government in its energy policy blueprint of at least 35% by 2020&nbsp;was already achieved in 2017. This trend was accelerated by legal measures such as the Renewable Energy Sources Act (Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz). Among other things, the Act requires grid operators to give priority to energy from renewable sources for electricity feed-in. If the trend of past years continues, the target for 2030&nbsp;is also likely to be achieved.<br><br>As in the case of indicator 7.2.a, with regard to the calculation method it should be noted that external trade in electricity directly influences the denominator of the indicator but not the numerator. Regardless of whether electricity is produced from renewable sources, net exports reduce gross electricity consumption, while net imports increase gross electricity consumption. Since 2003, Germany has increasingly been a net exporter of electricity, which means that the indicator has been overstating the actual share of renewable energies in gross electricity consumption over the subsequent period.<br><br>Since 2005, the share of renewable energies in electricity generation has risen, particularly because of the increased use of wind power, photovoltaics and biomass. Between 2005&nbsp;and 2019, declining electricity generation from conventional energy sources was offset by an increase of almost 180&nbsp;terawatt-hours in the production of electricity from renewable sources. In particular, onshore and offshore electricity generation from wind power soared from 27.8&nbsp;<abbr title="Terawatt hour">TWh</abbr> in 2005&nbsp;to 126&nbsp;<abbr title="Terawatt hour">TWh</abbr> in 2019. Offshore wind farms contributed about 24.7&nbsp;<abbr title="Terawatt hour">TWh</abbr> of the total in 2019. Electricity generation from photovoltaics rose between 2005&nbsp;and 2019&nbsp;from 1.3&nbsp;<abbr title="Terawatt hour">TWh</abbr> to 46.4&nbsp;TWh. Electricity generation from biomass more than trebled in the same period to 50.2&nbsp;TWh.'
