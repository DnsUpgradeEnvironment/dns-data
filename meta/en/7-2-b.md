national_indicator_available: Share of electricity from renewable energy sources in gross electricity consumption        

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator reflects the share of electricity from renewable energy sources in gross electricity consumption.        

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator represents the share of electricity from renewable energy sources in gross electricity consumption (in per cent).        

dns_indicator_intention: Switching to renewable energies (natural energy sources that constantly regenerate) can reduce the demand for fossil fuels. As a result, the dependency on imports of conventional fuels would be reduced, as would energy-related emissions, and hence the extent of climate change would be mitigated. The Federal Government had therefore set itself the aim of increasing the share of electricity from renewable sources in gross electricity consumption to at least 35&nbsp;% by 2020&nbsp;and at least 80&nbsp;%<sup>1</sup> by 2030. Before 2050, all electricity generated and consumed in Germany is to be greenhouse gas neutral. The target for 2030&nbsp;is based on the amendment of the Renewable Energy Sources Act (<abbr title="Renewable Energy Sources Act" tabindex="0">EEG</abbr>) in 2023, whereby the “renewable target” was realigned to a higher gross electricity consumption from 680&nbsp;to 750&nbsp;terawatt hours (<abbr title="Terawatt hour" tabindex="0">TWh</abbr>) in 2030&nbsp;and where 80&nbsp;% (previously 65&nbsp;%) has to be covered by electricity derived from renewable energy sources. In 2021, 234&nbsp;<abbr title="Terawatt hour" tabindex="0">TWh</abbr> electricity was derived from renewable energy sources. According to the amended renewable energy target, a third of gross electricity consumption was covered by electricity from renewable energy in the same year.<br><small><sup>1</sup>Adjustment of the target value from 65&nbsp;% by 2030&nbsp;according to policy resolution in 2022.</small>        

dns_political_intention: Switching to renewable energies, which are constantly regenerating as natural energy sources, can reduce the need for fossil fuels. This would both reduce our dependence on imports of conventional energy sources and reduce energy-related emissions, thereby curbing the extent of climate change.        

political_target: Increase to 80&nbsp;per cent by 2030        

type_target: Goal with a specific target value

content_and_progress: '<p style="opacity: 0.5"><b>Text from the <a href="https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/Publikationen/Indikatorenberichte/2022.pdf">Indicator Report 2022&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>The indicator is calculated by the Working Group on Renewable Energies Statistics (<abbr title="Working Group on Renewable Energy Statistics" tabindex="0">AGEE-Stat</abbr>) based on different official and unofficial sources. Gross electricity consumption is the sum of all generated and imported electricity minus the amount of exported electricity. It therefore comprises the domestic electricity generation, the balance of exchanges across national borders, the self-consumption of power plants as well as transmission losses. The following are considered to be renewable energy sources: wind energy, hydropower, solar radiation energy, geothermal energy and biomass including biogas, biomethane, landfill gas and gas from purification plants as well as the bio-degradable proportion of waste from households and the industry.<br><br>The target set by the German Government in its energy policy blueprint of at least 35&nbsp;% share of renewable energies on gross electricity consumption by 2020&nbsp;was already achieved in 2017. In subsequent years, the share maintained an increase up to 45.2&nbsp;% by 2020. This development was supported by legal measures, for instance the <abbr title="Renewable Energy Sources Act" tabindex="0">EEG</abbr>. The <abbr title="Renewable Energy Sources Act" tabindex="0">EEG</abbr> requires, among other things, network operators to give priority feed-in to renewable energy. In 2021, the share of renewable energy on gross energy consumption decreased to 41.1&nbsp;% and, thus, is not moving into the direction of the target value for 2030&nbsp;in the short-run. This can be explained by an increment in gross electricity consumption and weather-related decline in electricity production from renewable energy sources. However, even if the past long-term trend of previous years continues, the target for 2030&nbsp;would be missed. Moreover, the previous target of the Federal Government to derive 65&nbsp;% of the electricity from renewable resources by 2030&nbsp;would be missed, if the long-term trend continues. The target of 80&nbsp;% by 2030&nbsp;could only be achieved if the annual increment would be significantly higher than the previous long-term average. Further, an expected increase in electricity consumption exacerbates the achievement of the target value by 2030.<br><br>As in the case of indicator 7.2.a “Share of renewable energies in gross final energy consumption”, with regard to the calculation method it should be noted that external trade in electricity directly influences the denominator of the indicator but not the numerator<sup>1</sup>. Regardless of whether electricity is produced from renewable sources, net exports reduce gross electricity consumption, while net imports increase gross electricity consumption. Since 2003, Germany is a net exporter of electricity and reached the preliminary highest point in 2017. As a consequence, the actual share of renewable energies in gross electricity consumption is overestimated for the respective period.<br><br>Since 2005, the share of renewable energies in electricity generation has risen, particularly because of the increased use of wind power, photovoltaics and biomass. Between 2005&nbsp;and 2021, declining electricity generation from conventional energy sources was offset by an increase of almost 170&nbsp;<abbr title="Terawatt hour" tabindex="0">TWh</abbr> in the production of electricity from renewable sources. In particular, onshore and offshore electricity generation from wind power soared from 27.8&nbsp;<abbr title="Terawatt hour" tabindex="0">TWh</abbr> in 2005&nbsp;to 114&nbsp;<abbr title="Terawatt hour" tabindex="0">TWh</abbr> in 2021. Offshore wind farms contributed about 24.4&nbsp;<abbr title="Terawatt hour" tabindex="0">TWh</abbr> of the total in 2021. Electricity generation from photovoltaics rose between 2005&nbsp;and 2021&nbsp;from 1.3&nbsp;<abbr title="Terawatt hour" tabindex="0">TWh</abbr> to 50.0&nbsp;<abbr title="Terawatt hour" tabindex="0">TWh</abbr>. Electricity generation from biomass more than trebled in the same period to 50.4&nbsp;<abbr title="Terawatt hour" tabindex="0">TWh</abbr>.<br><br><small><sup>1</sup>This is a purely mathematical effect and does not refer to a correlation between the exchange balance and gross electricity consumption.</small></p>'

target_description: The share of electricity from renewable energy sources in gross electricity consumption is to be increased to at least 80&nbsp;per cent by 2030.<br><br><br>Based on the target formulation, indicator 7.2.b falls well short of the politically defined target if the average increase for the years 2019&nbsp;to 2024&nbsp;is maintained. The shortfall corresponds to more than 20&nbsp;per cent of the gap between the current value of the indicator (2024) and the target value. Accordingly, it is unlikely that the target will be achieved, meaning that indicator 7.2.b for 2024&nbsp;is rated as "cloud".
