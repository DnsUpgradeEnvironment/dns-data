national_indicator_available: Nitrate in groundwater        

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the share of monitoring points at which the threshold value of 50&nbsp;<abbr title="Miligrams per litre" tabindex="0">mg/l</abbr> of nitrate in the groundwater is not exceeded on an annual average.        

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator shows the proportion of measuring points (in per cent) at which the limit value of 50&nbsp;milligrams per litre of nitrate in groundwater is complied with on an annual average.        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: Groundwater is an essential element of the ecosystem. It is part of the water cycle and fulfils important ecological functions. Groundwater is also Germany's most important drinking water resource. However, elevated nitrate levels impair the ecology of water bodies.        

political_target: Compliance with the nitrate threshold value of 50<br>milligrams per litre at all monitoring points by 2030        

type_target: Consistent target every year        

data_state: 15.01.2025        

indicator_name: Nitrate in groundwater

content_and_progress: '<p><b style= "color: #26bde2; font-size: large">6.1.b Nitrate in groundwater</b><br><br>The nitrate content of groundwater is recorded by the Länder for the purpose of reporting the condition of groundwater in Germany to the European Environment Agency (<abbr title="European Environment Agency" tabindex="0">EEA</abbr>). The monitoring points used for this purpose are combined in the “EEA monitoring network”. The <abbr title="European Environment Agency" tabindex="0">EEA</abbr> monitoring network comprises a total of 1,214&nbsp;monitoring sites and provides a representative picture of Germany. The data are summarised by the German Environment Agency based on information from the German Working Group on Water Issues of the Länder and the Federal Government represented by the Federal Environment Ministry (<abbr title="German Working Group on Water Issues of the Länder and the Federal Government" tabindex="0">LAWA</abbr>).<br><br>Like the indicator of phosphorus content in flowing waters, the nitrate indicator does not reveal how far above or below the threshold the readings have been. The indicator merely records how many of all the monitoring sites complied with the prescribed threshold. The nitrate load may have fallen sharply at some monitoring sites. Nevertheless, if the concentration remains above the maximum of 50&nbsp;<abbr title="Miligrams per litre" tabindex="0">mg/l</abbr>, the reduction will not be reflected in the indicator. The same applies to nitrate loads that have increased but are still below the threshold. The interpretation must also take into account that measures to reduce nitrate pollution may have a delayed effect, since the period of infiltration from the surface to the groundwater can take several years.<br><br>The naturally occurring level of nitrate lies between 0&nbsp;and 10&nbsp;<abbr title="Miligrams per litre" tabindex="0">mg/l</abbr>. Concentrations between 10&nbsp;and 25&nbsp;<abbr title="Miligrams per litre" tabindex="0">mg/l</abbr> indicate minor to medium loads. Concentrations between 25&nbsp;and 50&nbsp;milligrams per liter indicate severe groundwater contamination. Figures above the threshold of 50&nbsp;<abbr title="Miligrams per litre" tabindex="0">mg/l</abbr> which is set in the Ground Water Ordinance and which also underlies this indicator mean that the groundwater has a poor chemical status and cannot be used as drinking water without treatment.<br><br>In 2020&nbsp;the target of less than 50&nbsp;<abbr title="Miligrams" tabindex="0">mg</abbr> of nitrate per litre was met at 84.1&nbsp;% of all monitoring sites. Since 2008, the percentage of monitoring sites at which this target is met has remained virtually unchanged. This means that the goal of recording concentrations below the threshold at all monitoring sites has not been achieved and that the indicator value is not recognisably moving in that direction. Conversely, in 2020&nbsp;the nitrate threshold of 50&nbsp;<abbr title="Miligrams per litre" tabindex="0">mg/l</abbr> was exceeded at 15.9&nbsp;% of the groundwater monitoring sites in the <abbr title="European Environment Agency" tabindex="0">EEA</abbr> monitoring network. At 17.8&nbsp;% of the monitoring sites the nitrate value lay between 25&nbsp;and 50&nbsp;<abbr title="Miligrams per litre" tabindex="0">mg/l</abbr>, which still indicates an elevated degree of pollution. This percentage rate also remained virtually unchanged over the years.<br><br>The pollution of groundwater with nitrate is caused primarily by the leaching of nitrate from various nitrogen fertilisers. Besides farmyard manures such as liquid manure and slurry, these also include the mineral fertilisers that are used in intensive crop-farming. The last few years have also seen an increase in the use of digestate, which occurs as a by-product of biogas power plants, as an agricultural fertiliser. All of these things can contribute to higher nitrate values in groundwater if fertilisation is not matched to specific crop requirements. Accordingly, the development of indicator 2.1.a “Nitrogen surplus in agriculture” influences the nitrate load in groundwater.<br><br>In order to measure the actual influence of agricultural activity on the nitrate load of waters, there is a separate system of nitrate reporting to the <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr>. For this report, the monitoring sites for waters in predominantly agricultural catchment areas are selected from the <abbr title="European Environment Agency" tabindex="0">EEA</abbr> site network. The nitrate load in that specific part of the monitoring network is therefore above the average for indicator 6.1.b.</p>'

target_description: The proportion of monitoring sites at which the threshold value for nitrate in groundwater is met should be 100&nbsp;per cent every year.<br><br><br>Based on the target formulation, the politically defined target was repeatedly not achieved in 2023. However, as the average development of the indicator over the last six years points in the desired direction, indicator 6.1.b is rated as "cloud" for 2023.
