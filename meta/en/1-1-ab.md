national_indicator_available: Material deprivation and severe material deprivation        

dns_indicator_definition: "Material deprivation describes the lack of specific consumer goods and the involuntary foregoing of discretionary consumption for financial reasons. The two indicators represent the proportion of people out of the total population who are deemed to suffer either material deprivation (1.1.a) or severe material deprivation (1.1.b). The designation of (severe) material deprivation applies to all people whose household meets at least three (severely materially deprived: at least four) of nine defined criteria reflecting the financial restrictions of the household."        

dns_indicator_definition_new: "The indicators represent the proportion of people in the total population (in per cent) who are considered to be materially and socially deprived (1.1.a) or significantly materially and socially deprived (1.1.b). Material and social deprivation describes the involuntary renunciation of selected consumption due to financial problems and the lack of certain consumer goods for financial reasons. (Significant) material and social deprivation applies to all people whose household fulfils at least five (significantly materially and socially deprived: at least seven) of thirteen predefined criteria that reflect the financial limitations of the household. Six of the thirteen criteria relate to individuals and seven to the entire household."        

dns_indicator_intention: The indicator “material deprivation” also is part of the extensive reporting on poverty and wealth conducted by the Federal Government. By identifying individual deficiencies, it aims to act as a substitute for illustrating living conditions threatened by poverty. The target is to combat material deprivation, therefore both, the percentage of persons who are materially as well as severely materially deprived, should stay below the level within the European Union.        

dns_political_intention: "The ‘material and social deprivation’ indicator (also: material and social deprivation) is intended to identify individual situations of deprivation in order to illustrate living conditions at risk of poverty. It is also part of the Federal Government's detailed poverty and wealth report."

As a consequence, the data since survey year 2020&nbsp;are not comparable with prior survey years. <br><br>The selected survey variables are expenditures based on a lifestyle that is considered appropriate, desirable or even necessary in Europe. These nine criteria used to characterise material deprivation are standardised across all countries in which <abbr title="EU-Statistics on Income and Living Conditions" tabindex="0">EU-SILC</abbr> is conducted, thereby allowing Europe-wide comparisons. Survey results are derived from self-assessment of households. According to the definition of <abbr title="EU-Statistics on Income and Living Conditions" tabindex="0">EU-SILC</abbr>, households are characterized to suffer from (severe) material deprivation, if they fulfil at least three (severe material deprivation: at least four) of the following nine criteria:<br><br>   1. 	Financial difficulties to pay for rent, mortgages, or utility bills on time.<br><br>   2. 	Financial difficulties to ensure adequate heating in the residence.<br><br>   3. 	Financial difficulties to meet unplanned expenditures of a specific amount from one’s own financial resources.<br><br>   4. 	Financial difficulties to eat meat, fish or an equivalent vegetarian meal every second day.<br><br>   5. 	Financial difficulties to spend one week’s holidays per year outside the actual residence.<br><br>   6. 	Lack of a car in the household due to financial reasons.<br><br>   7. 	Lack of a washing machine in the household due to financial reasons.<br><br>   8. 	Lack of a colour TV in the household due to financial reasons. <br><br>   9. 	Lack of a telephone in the household due to financial reasons.<br><br>Until 2019, the shares of the population experiencing both material deprivation and severe material deprivation declined over time for Germany as in the European Union (<abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr>) as a whole. At all times, the values for Germany were always significantly lower than those for the <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr>.<br><br>In 2020&nbsp;13.4&nbsp;% of the population in Germany were affected by material deprivation. This value is slightly higher than the value for the <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr> population that is 13.3&nbsp;%, which was calculated by the Statistical Office of the European Union (<abbr title="European Statistical Office" tabindex="0">Eurostat</abbr>) excluding the United Kingdom (Brexit) for the first time in 2020. For this reason, and due to the above-mentioned methodological changes to the survey design, the value is only comparable with the previous year"s figures to a limited extent. Even after the <abbr title="United Kingdom" tabindex="0">UK</abbr>"s <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr> exit and methodological adjustments to the survey, the rate of people experiencing severe material deprivation in Germany in 2020&nbsp;remained below the <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr> figure of 5.9&nbsp;% at 5.6&nbsp;%. The German government"s target for severe material deprivation was thus just achieved.<br><br>The indicator on "severe material deprivation" has been redefined and expanded in the <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr> as part of the Europe 2030&nbsp;targets, in that additional criteria on social deprivation are now also taken into account. At the European level, therefore, only the indicators "rate of (severe) material and social deprivation" will be provided in the future. A corresponding adjustment of the goals and indicators of the German Sustainability Strategy will therefore be necessary.</p>'
