national_indicator_available: Raw material input productivity        

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator of raw material input productivity compares the value of all goods provided for final use (in euros, price-adjusted) relative to the mass of the raw materials used domestically and abroad for their production (in tonnes). Final use covers domestic consumption and domestic investments as well as exports.<br>The denominator of the indicator takes into account abiotic and biotic raw materials from the environment as well as plant materials produced by farming and forestry. In the graph, the development of the indicator itself and of both the numerator and the denominator are traced separately.        

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator shows total raw material productivity compared to the base year 2010. The indicator compares the value of all goods sold for final use (in euros, price-adjusted) with the mass of raw materials used for their production at home and abroad (in tonnes). The last use includes both domestic consumption and domestic investment as well as exports. The denominator of the indicator includes both abiotic and biotic raw materials extracted from the environment as well as plant material produced by agriculture and forestry. The graph shows the indicator itself as well as the numerator and denominator separately.        

dns_indicator_intention: The extraction of raw materials always entails some impairment of the natural environment. Owing to the growing demand for raw materials, raw material deposits in all parts of the world are increasingly being extracted in areas that are particularly sensitive to human intervention. For this reason, back in 2016, in the German Resource Efficiency Programme (ProgRess) II, the Federal Government set itself the goal of ensuring a continuing rise in raw material input productivity. In the years 2000&nbsp;to 2010, raw material input productivity was already increasing at an average rate of around 1.6&nbsp;% annually. The aim is to maintain this kind of positive trend up to 2030.        

dns_political_intention: The extraction of raw materials is always associated with a negative impact on nature. Due to the growing demand for raw materials, raw material deposits are increasingly being tapped worldwide in areas that are particularly sensitive to human impact. For this reason, the German government set itself the goal of further increasing overall raw material productivity in the German Resource Efficiency Programme (ProgRess) II in 2016.        

political_target: Maintaining the trend of the years 2000-2010&nbsp;until 2030

content_and_progress: '<p style="opacity: 0.5"><b>Text from the <a href="https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/Publikationen/Indikatorenberichte/2022.pdf">Indicator Report 2022&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>To calculate this indicator, it is necessary to determine the mass of all raw materials required to produce the imports. The calculation of this variable, referred to as imports in raw material equivalents, is based on a complex model that employs data from various official and unofficial sources.<br><br>Due to the monetary and physical inclusion of imports, the indicator takes into account the value added and raw material use across the entire production chain both inside and outside of Germany. In this way, the economic interdependence with foreign countries is also taken into account comprehensively. The raw material use mapped in the indicator covers not only domestic final use but also exports. It should therefore not be confused with a resource footprint for Germany.<br><br>The indicator includes not only the raw materials that were considered to be non-renewable, that is, mineral raw materials and fossile fuels, but also plant-based products from farming and forestry activities. This means that double counting occurs to a limited degree. For example, both the mass of an agricultural product at harvest time as well as that of the mineral fertiliser used to produce it are recorded.<br><br>The value of the indicator increased by 26&nbsp;% from 2000&nbsp;to 2018. This increase results in particular from the growth of the numerator: the value of the final use (domestic consumption and domestic investments as well as exports) increased by 46&nbsp;% during the reference period. The removal of domestic raw materials fell moderately between 2000&nbsp;and 2018; at the same time, however, the mass of imports in raw material equivalents increased, causing a slight increase of 16&nbsp;% in the indicator’s denominator.<br><br>Domestically extracted raw materials as well as imports are also being exported (again) to an increasing degree. Consequently, the indicator’s denominator does not point to increased global raw material extraction for consumption and investment in Germany, but reflects generally more intensive links between the German economy and the outside world.<br><br>The year 2009&nbsp;should be considered an outlier due to the exceptional economic situation in the European financial market and economic crisis. In 2010&nbsp;and 2011, investments and exports, as well as the associated input of raw materials, rose sharply again. This marked a resumption of the trend that had been seen in the period up to 2008. Although raw material input productivity slightly decreased or stagnated at some points in time, the general trend tended to improve. The indicator increased by 5&nbsp;percentage points in 2017&nbsp;compared to the preceding year, however, 2018&nbsp;recorded a slight decline by 1&nbsp;percentage point. In total, raw material input productivity increased from 2010&nbsp;to 2018&nbsp;by 9&nbsp;percentage points with an average annual growth of 0.9&nbsp;% and, thus, lies below the target of the Federal Government.</p>'

target_description: The target allows for various interpretations. For the assessment of indicator 8.1&nbsp;carried out here, the geometric mean of the increase in the indicator value between 2000&nbsp;and 2010&nbsp;is calculated and used as the basis for the desired trend up to 2030. Standardised to the 2010&nbsp;value, this results in a target value of 136.8&nbsp;for the year 2030. Accordingly, total raw material productivity should be increased to at least 136.8&nbsp;percent of the 2010&nbsp;value by 2030.<br><br><br>If the trend from 2017&nbsp;to 2022&nbsp;continues, this value will be reached in 2030, meaning that indicator 8.1&nbsp;for 2022&nbsp;is rated as "Sun".
