national_indicator_available: Number of students and researchers from developing countries and least developed countries        

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator records the number of students and researchers from developing and emerging countries per year or semester. Here, the number of students and researchers from the least developed countries (<abbr title="Least developed countries" tabindex="0">LDCs</abbr>) is listed separately.        

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator shows the number of students and researchers from developing and emerging countries per year or semester. The number of students and researchers from the Least Developed Countries (<abbr title="Least developed countries" tabindex="0">LDCs</abbr>) is shown separately.        

dns_indicator_intention: Knowledge is a key driver of sustainable development not only at national level but also in global terms. The strengthening of the international exchange of knowledge by Germany is an important measure in this context. For this reason, the target of the Federal Government is to increase the total number of students and researchers from developing and emerging countries by 10&nbsp;% from 2015&nbsp;until 2020&nbsp;and to stabilise the number at the same level thereafter.        

dns_political_intention: Knowledge is a key driver of sustainable development not only at a national level, but also on a global scale. Strengthening the international exchange of knowledge through Germany is an important measure in this regard.        

political_target: Increase the number by 10&nbsp;per cent from 2015&nbsp;to 2020,<br>then stabilise        

type_target: Consistent target every year

content_and_progress: '<p style="opacity: 0.5"><b>Text from the <a href="https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/Publikationen/Indikatorenberichte/2022.pdf">Indicator Report 2022&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>The indicator is based on data from the student statistics and the higher education personnel statistics compiled by the Federal Statistical Office (Statistisches Bundesamt). Both are full surveys derived from administrative data provided by higher education institutions. The indicator encompasses students enrolled in each respective winter semester. Data on researchers are collected as of the reference date 1&nbsp;December. Researchers are defined as academic staff employed full-time or part-time at German higher education institutions; student assistants are excluded. Doctoral candidates who are simultaneously employed as academic staff may lead to double counting within the indicator.<br><br>In 2023, the total number of students and researchers from developing and emerging countries at German higher education institutions was approximately 349,000. Students accounted for the vast majority of this figure, comprising 91.3% of the total.<br><br>In the winter semester 2023/24, 318,663&nbsp;students from developing and emerging countries were enrolled at German higher education institutions. This represents a share of 11.1% of all enrolled students. The largest groups of students from developing and emerging countries came from India (49,483), China (42,190), and Turkey (35,559).<br><br>Since the winter semester 2005/06&nbsp;(134,462&nbsp;students), the number of students from developing and emerging countries has risen continuously&nbsp;–&nbsp;with the sole exception of a decline recorded in the winter semester 2007/08. Compared to the previous year (approximately 307,000&nbsp;students in the winter semester 2022/23), the number rose by 3.8% in the winter semester 2023/24. Among these students were 19,505&nbsp;from the Least Developed Countries (<abbr title="Least developed countries" tabindex="0">LDCs</abbr>), marking an increase of 6.5% compared to the previous winter semester.<br><br>Overall, the proportion of women among students from developing and emerging countries at German higher education institutions stood at 42.0%. When focusing exclusively on students from <abbr title="Least developed countries" tabindex="0">LDCs</abbr>, the female share was considerably lower, at 31.2%.<br><br>The gender ratio among students from European (54.3% female) and American (50.6% female) developing and emerging countries is relatively balanced. In contrast, among students from African developing and emerging countries, only 34.5% were women.<br><br>In 2023, around 30,000&nbsp;researchers from developing and emerging countries were part of the academic staff at German higher education institutions. This corresponds to a share of 7.1% of the total academic personnel&nbsp;–&nbsp;substantially lower than the corresponding proportion among students. Compared to the previous year, the number of researchers increased by 7.8%, and since 2005, it has quadrupled. A total of 1,190&nbsp;researchers from <abbr title="Least developed countries" tabindex="0">LDCs</abbr> were recorded in 2023, representing 0.3% of all academic personnel (previous year: 1,070).<br><br>It should be noted that changes in the figures and year-on-year comparisons may also result from adjustments in the classification of countries as <abbr title="Least developed countries" tabindex="0">LDCs</abbr> or as developing and emerging economies.<br><br>The political target to increase the number of students and researchers from developing and emerging countries by 10% compared to 2015&nbsp;(215,000) was already achieved in 2017. Since then, the intended stabilisation of these figures has also been realised.</p>'

target_description: The number of students and researchers from developing countries and least developed countries should be at least 237,000&nbsp;every year.<br><br><br>Based on the target formulation, the increase in the number by 10&nbsp;per cent of the 2015&nbsp;figure corresponds to a total number of 237,000&nbsp;students and researchers, which must be maintained every year since 2020. The politically defined target value was achieved in 2023&nbsp;and the average development over the last six years points in the right direction, meaning that indicator 17.2&nbsp;for 2023&nbsp;is rated as "Sun".
