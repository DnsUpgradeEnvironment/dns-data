dns_political_intention: Pay gaps between women and men are a sign of social inequality in modern labour societies. The reduction in wage differences is an indicator of progress towards equality.        

political_target: Reduce the gap to 10&nbsp;per cent by 2020, maintained until<br>2030        

type_target: Goal with a specific target value

content_and_progress: '<p><b style= "color: #ff3a21; font-size: large">5.1.a Gender pay gap</b><br><br>This indicator reflects the unadjusted gender pay gap (<abbr title="Gender pay gap" tabindex="0">GPG</abbr>), which exclusively illustrates the ratio of average gross hourly earnings of women compared to men. As such, the unadjusted <abbr title="Gender pay gap" tabindex="0">GPG</abbr> also encompasses pay disparities that arise from factors such as differences in occupation, sector affiliation, qualifications, or employment histories between women and men.<br><br>Until and including 2021, the indicator was based on the four-yearly structure of earnings survey. Since 2022, the annual earnings survey has served as the data basis. This survey is conducted by the statistical offices of the Länder as a representative sample survey with compulsory participation from up to 58,000&nbsp;enterprises. On the basis of these data, results are calculated by age, level of education, performance group, occupation, collective bargaining coverage, enterprise size, and economic sector, and the adjusted gender pay gap is determined. Both indicators&nbsp;–&nbsp;adjusted and unadjusted&nbsp;–&nbsp;are calculated according to the <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr> definition, which excludes employees in “agriculture, forestry and fishing”, “public administration, defence, and compulsory social security”, and in micro-enterprises.<br><br>Between 2020&nbsp;and 2023, women earned on average 18&nbsp;% less per hour than men. In 2024, this gap narrowed to 16&nbsp;%. The target of reducing the unadjusted <abbr title="Gender pay gap" tabindex="0">GPG</abbr> to 10&nbsp;% by 2020&nbsp;was therefore not achieved. Continuing along the current trajectory, it is not expected that this goal will be met by 2030&nbsp;either.<br><br>In the long term, Germany has shown a slow but steady decrease in the unadjusted GPG: in 2012, it stood at 23&nbsp;%, which is 7&nbsp;percentage points higher than the 2024&nbsp;figure. A comparison across the Länder reveals significant regional disparities: in 2024, Baden-Württemberg and Hesse recorded the highest earnings gaps, each at 19&nbsp;%, while Saxony-Anhalt (4&nbsp;%) and Brandenburg (2&nbsp;%) reported the lowest values.<br><br>Analyses into the causes of the <abbr title="Gender pay gap" tabindex="0">GPG</abbr> show that approximately 63&nbsp;% of the earnings gap can be attributed to the fact that women are more often employed in lower-paid professions, sectors, and positions. Another key factor is the extent of employment: women work part-time more frequently than men, which typically correlates with lower average gross hourly earnings. This aspect accounts for around 19&nbsp;% of the pay gap. Around 12&nbsp;% can be attributed to differences in the performance level required by the job.<br><br>The remaining 37&nbsp;% of the pay gap corresponds to the adjusted <abbr title="Gender pay gap" tabindex="0">GPG</abbr>, which was 6&nbsp;% in 2024. In contrast to the unadjusted <abbr title="Gender pay gap" tabindex="0">GPG</abbr>, the adjusted figure shows a far more consistent picture across the Länder: in 2024, it stood at 6&nbsp;% in the former West Germany including Berlin, and at 8&nbsp;% in the new Länder. A detailed evaluation by individual Länder is not possible due to methodological fluctuations since the introduction of the new earnings survey in 2022.<br><br>At the European level, mostly data until 2023&nbsp;are available. Since 2010, the unadjusted <abbr title="Gender pay gap" tabindex="0">GPG</abbr> in Germany has consistently remained above the <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr> average. Only Latvia recorded a higher gender-based earnings disparity at 19&nbsp;%. Austria, Czechia, and Hungary&nbsp;–&nbsp;like Germany&nbsp;–&nbsp;each reported a <abbr title="Gender pay gap" tabindex="0">GPG</abbr> of 18&nbsp;%. The smallest differences in gross hourly earnings between women and men were observed in Luxembourg (‒1&nbsp;%), Belgium (1&nbsp;%), and Italy (2&nbsp;%).</p>'
