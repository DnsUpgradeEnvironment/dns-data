national_indicator_available: Private and public expenditure on research and development        

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the expenditure on research and development by businesses, general government and institutions of higher education in relation to gross domestic product (<abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>).        

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator shows internal expenditure on research and development (<abbr title="Research and development" tabindex="0">R&D</abbr>) by industry, the state and universities in relation to gross domestic product (<abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>) (as a percentage).        

dns_indicator_intention: Expenditure on research and development (<abbr title="Research and development" tabindex="0">R&D</abbr>) is an important, although not the only determinant of an economy’s rate of innovation. The higher the expenditure, the higher the probability of more dynamic gains in productivity, the stronger economic growth and the more competitiveness is improved. The Federal Government has therefore set itself the goal of ensuring that private and public expenditure on research and development&nbsp;–&nbsp;a major determinant for the innovation rate of an economy&nbsp;–&nbsp;increases to at least an annual 3.5&nbsp;% of gross domestic product by 2025.        

dns_political_intention: Expenditure on research and development (<abbr title="Research and development" tabindex="0">R&D</abbr>) is an important, if not the sole, determinant of the pace of innovation in an economy. The higher the expenditure, the greater the likelihood of a more dynamic development in productivity, stronger economic growth and improved competitiveness.        

political_target: At least 3.5&nbsp;per cent of gross domestic product (<abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>) annually until 2025        

type_target: Consistent target every year

The main criterion applied to differentiate between <abbr title="Research and development" tabindex="0">R&D</abbr> and related activities is whether the activity involves an appreciable element of newness or further development.<br><br>The share of research and development expenditure in the gross domestic product (<abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>) is determined annually by the Federal Statistical Office. Overall expenditure on research and development comprises expenditure by general government (including non-profit private research institutions), institutions of higher education, and businesses. The surveys and calculations adhere to the recommended methodologies of the Frascati Manual of the <abbr title="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development" tabindex="0">OECD</abbr> on statistics about <abbr title="Research and development" tabindex="0">R&D</abbr>, which also enable international comparisons.<br><br>Overall <abbr title="Research and development" tabindex="0">R&D</abbr> expenditure in Germany in 2020&nbsp;amounted to 106.6&nbsp;billion euros, equivalent to 3.1&nbsp;% of <abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>. Hence, the indicator was 0.4&nbsp;percentage points below the annual target of 3.5&nbsp;% of <abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr> by 2025. If the past development continues, it can be assumed that the target value will not be reached.<br><br>Since 2000, the share of <abbr title="Research and development" tabindex="0">R&D</abbr> in relation to <abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr> in Germany has increased by about 0.7&nbsp;percentage points. Compared to 2000, the expenditures for <abbr title="Research and development" tabindex="0">R&D</abbr> have doubled. Compared to the preceding year 2019, the expenditure for <abbr title="Research and development" tabindex="0">R&D</abbr> activities decreased in the first year of the <abbr title="Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2" tabindex="0">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic by 3.4&nbsp;billion euros. However, this decline is completely limited to the economic sector and, in fact, the other two sectors recorded increments.<br><br>In 2020, businesses accounted for the by far largest share of <abbr title="Research and development" tabindex="0">R&D</abbr> expenditure in Germany at around 66.6&nbsp;%, with 18.7&nbsp;% spent by institutions of higher education and a further 14.6&nbsp;% by both public and private non-profit research institutions. Staff employed in <abbr title="Research and development" tabindex="0">R&D</abbr> comprised around 733,831&nbsp;full-time equivalents, a figure that includes only the share of their working hours actually spent on <abbr title="Research and development" tabindex="0">R&D</abbr> work. Some 63.7&nbsp;% of the staff work in businesses, 20.7&nbsp;% in institutions of higher education and 15.6&nbsp;% in public and private non-profit research institutions.<br><br>In an international comparison among <abbr title="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development" tabindex="0">OECD</abbr> member states, Germany reached 3.1&nbsp;% in 2020&nbsp;and was ahead of Denmark (3.0&nbsp;%) and Finland (2.9&nbsp;%), further, Germany exceeds the value of the <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr> 27&nbsp;region with its 2.2&nbsp;% and the <abbr title="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development" tabindex="0">OECD</abbr> average of 2.7&nbsp;% of <abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>. Eight States, for instance Sweden (3.5&nbsp;%) or Japan (3.3&nbsp;%), were ahead of Germany. On a national level, Baden-Württemberg at 5.7&nbsp;% (year 2020) was far ahead of other German Länder, followed by Bremen at 3.7&nbsp;% and Bavaria at 3.4&nbsp;% of <abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>.</p>'
