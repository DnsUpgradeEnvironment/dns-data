It has issued a set of standards to which more than 200&nbsp;countries worldwide have committed. The <abbr title="Financial Action Task Force" tabindex="0">FATF</abbr> Standards comprise 40&nbsp;Recommendations, which represent an essential component of international efforts to ensure the integrity and security of the global financial system and serve as the basis for national laws in many member states. The <abbr title="Financial Action Task Force" tabindex="0">FATF</abbr> conducts regular evaluations in its member states, which not only review and assess the technical implementation of the Recommendations (technical compliance), but also their effectiveness in practice.<br><br><br><br>The most recent Germany audit as part of the <abbr title="Financial Action Task Force" tabindex="0">FATF</abbr> evaluation process took place from autumn 2020&nbsp;to June 2022. A visit by <abbr title="Financial Action Task Force" tabindex="0">FATF</abbr> auditors was also part of the audit process. During this visit, interviews were conducted with stakeholders from both the public sector (such as the Federal Ministry of Finance (<abbr title="Federal Ministry of Finance" tabindex="0">BMF</abbr>), the judiciary, law enforcement agencies, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), and state supervisory authorities) and with stakeholders from the private sector (such as banks and financial service providers, and professional groups such as notaries, tax advisors, lawyers, and auditors). The review process highlights both the complexity and importance of cooperation in combating financial crime within the framework of the <abbr title="Financial Action Task Force" tabindex="0">FATF</abbr> assessment. The overall coordination of the Germany review within the Federal Government was the <abbr title="Federal Ministry of Finance" tabindex="0">BMF</abbr>.<br><br>The assessment of effectiveness is based on eleven interim objectives, the so-called Immediate Outcomes (IOs), which cover various areas of combating financial crime. These intermediate objectives are:<br><br><u>Overarching</u><ul><li><abbr title="Immediate Outcomes" tabindex="0">IO</abbr> 1: Risk understanding and coordination</li><li><abbr title="Immediate Outcomes" tabindex="0">IO</abbr> 2: International cooperation</li></ul><u>Prevention of abuse (prevention)</u><ul><li><abbr title="Immediate Outcomes" tabindex="0">IO</abbr> 3: Supervisory authorities</li><li><abbr title="Immediate Outcomes" tabindex="0">IO</abbr> 4: Preventive measures by supervised entities</li><li><abbr title="Immediate Outcomes" tabindex="0">IO</abbr> 5: Beneficial owners</li></ul><u>Combating and prosecuting (repression)</u><ul><li><abbr title="Immediate Outcomes" tabindex="0">IO</abbr> 6: Financial analysis and investigations</li><li><abbr title="Immediate Outcomes" tabindex="0">IO</abbr> 7: Money laundering investigations and prosecution</li><li><abbr title="Immediate Outcomes" tabindex="0">IO</abbr> 8: Asset recovery in money laundering</li><li><abbr title="Immediate Outcomes" tabindex="0">IO</abbr> 9: Terrorist financing; investigation and prosecution</li><li><abbr title="Immediate Outcomes" tabindex="0">IO</abbr> 10: Financial sanctions; Non-profit organization (NPO)</li><li><abbr title="Immediate Outcomes" tabindex="0">IO</abbr> 11: Financing proliferation.</li></ul>Each interim target receives a rating ranging from "low" to "moderate" to "solid" and "high." For this indicator, the total number of interim targets rated "solid" or "high" is reported. Changes, both positive and negative, between the "low" and "moderate" categories, as well as between "solid" and "high" for individual interim targets, will therefore not be captured by this indicator in the next reporting year.<br><br><br><br>In the 2022&nbsp;Germany review, four of the eleven interim targets (<abbr title="Immediate Outcomes" tabindex="0">IO</abbr> 1, <abbr title="Immediate Outcomes" tabindex="0">IO</abbr> 2, <abbr title="Immediate Outcomes" tabindex="0">IO</abbr> 8, and <abbr title="Immediate Outcomes" tabindex="0">IO</abbr> 9) were rated as solid and thus passed. The remaining seven interim targets (<abbr title="Immediate Outcomes" tabindex="0">IO</abbr> 3, <abbr title="Immediate Outcomes" tabindex="0">IO</abbr> 4, <abbr title="Immediate Outcomes" tabindex="0">IO</abbr> 5, <abbr title="Immediate Outcomes" tabindex="0">IO</abbr> 6, <abbr title="Immediate Outcomes" tabindex="0">IO</abbr> 7, <abbr title="Immediate Outcomes" tabindex="0">IO</abbr> 10, and <abbr title="Immediate Outcomes" tabindex="0">IO</abbr> 11) received a moderate rating and are therefore considered failed. The politically defined objective for the next Germany review in 2029&nbsp;is to achieve a positive assessment in at least eight of the eleven interim targets.<br><br><br><br>With regard to the <abbr title="Financial Action Task Force" tabindex="0">FATF</abbr> technical requirements (Technical Compliance), Germany"s international standards were assessed as "largely implemented." Of the 40&nbsp;<abbr title="Financial Action Task Force" tabindex="0">FATF</abbr> recommendations, none were considered "not implemented" in the 2022&nbsp;Germany review. Only five of the recommendations were considered "partially implemented." In response to this assessment, improvements were made, allowing two of these five to be upgraded to "largely implemented" in the 2023&nbsp;follow-up report. The three remaining recommendations, which were only partially implemented, relate to the areas of "Corresponding Banking," "Transparency and Beneficial Ownership of Legal Persons," and "Statistics." Thus, in 2023, 37&nbsp;of the <abbr title="Financial Action Task Force" tabindex="0">FATF</abbr> recommendations were considered "largely implemented" (20) or "implemented" (17).</p>'
